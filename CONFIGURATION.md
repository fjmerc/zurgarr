# Configuration Reference

Every environment variable Zurgarr reads, grouped by feature. This is the
long reference — for a first-time walkthrough see the
[README](README.md) or the
[Blackhole Symlink Guide](BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_GUIDE.md).

## How to set a variable

Three options, any of them work:

1. **`.env` file** next to `docker-compose.yml` (recommended). The commented
   [`.env.example`](.env.example) is a ready-to-copy template.
2. **`environment:`** block in `docker-compose.yml` — useful for values
   you share across containers.
3. **Web UI** at `http://your-host:8080/settings` after you've set
   `STATUS_UI_AUTH`. Saves to `.env` and applies most changes without a
   restart (SIGHUP reload).

## Minimum required to start

| Variable | Why |
|---|---|
| `RD_API_KEY` (or `AD_API_KEY` or `TORBOX_API_KEY`) | Zurg can't connect without a debrid account |
| `STATUS_UI_AUTH` | Unlocks the web UI at `/settings`. Format: `user:password` |

Everything else has a sensible default or is opt-in.

## Debrid & mount (always required)

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `TZ` | [Timezone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) | |
| `ZURG_ENABLED` | Enable Zurg | `false` |
| `RD_API_KEY` | [Real-Debrid API key](https://real-debrid.com/apitoken) | |
| `AD_API_KEY` | [AllDebrid API key](https://alldebrid.com/apikeys/) | |
| `TORBOX_API_KEY` | [TorBox API key](https://torbox.app/settings). Powers cache probes, search-add, and dual-debrid blackhole routing. For the WebDAV mount, see [TorBox co-debrid](#torbox-co-debrid-mount-plan-39). | |
| `RCLONE_MOUNT_NAME` | Name for the rclone mount | |
| `RCLONE_LOG_LEVEL` | [rclone log level](https://rclone.org/docs/#log-level-level). `OFF` to suppress | `NOTICE` |
| `RCLONE_DIR_CACHE_TIME` | [Directory cache duration](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/#vfs-directory-cache) | `10s` |
| `RCLONE_CACHE_DIR` | [Cache directory](https://rclone.org/docs/#cache-dir-dir) | |
| `RCLONE_VFS_CACHE_MODE` | [VFS cache mode](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/#vfs-file-caching) | `off` (FUSE) / `full` (NFS) |
| `RCLONE_VFS_CACHE_MAX_SIZE` | Max VFS cache size | |
| `RCLONE_VFS_CACHE_MAX_AGE` | Max VFS cache age | |
| `RCLONE_VFS_READ_CHUNK_SIZE` | Initial read chunk size | |
| `RCLONE_VFS_READ_CHUNK_SIZE_LIMIT` | Max read chunk size | |
| `RCLONE_BUFFER_SIZE` | Buffer size for transfers | |
| `RCLONE_TRANSFERS` | Parallel transfers | |

| `ZURG_LOG_LEVEL` | Zurg log level. `OFF` to suppress | `INFO` |
| `ZURG_USER` | WebDAV basic auth username | |
| `ZURG_PASS` | WebDAV basic auth password | |
| `ZURG_PORT` | WebDAV port. Set a fixed value if exposing to other machines | random |
| `NFS_ENABLED` | Enable rclone NFS server (does NOT create a local mount — use FUSE if Plex is on the same host) | `false` |
| `NFS_PORT` | NFS server port | random |

---

## TorBox co-debrid mount (plan 39)

TorBox runs as an *additive* co-debrid alongside Real-Debrid (or AllDebrid).
Zurg can't proxy TorBox, so the mount goes through rclone's native webdav
remote against `https://webdav.torbox.app/`. Setting `TORBOX_API_KEY` alone
enables cache probes / search-add / blackhole routing. To get the WebDAV
mount you need the two `TORBOX_WEBDAV_*` vars as well.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `TORBOX_API_KEY` | TorBox API key (cache probes, search, blackhole) | |
| `TORBOX_WEBDAV_USER` | TorBox account email used for WebDAV Basic auth | |
| `TORBOX_WEBDAV_PASS` | WebDAV-only password from the TorBox dashboard → Settings → Integrations → WebDAV. **Not** the account password, **not** the API key. | |
| `TORBOX_MOUNT_NAME` | Mount path under `/data` (must not collide with `RCLONE_MOUNT_NAME`) | `torbox` |
| `TORBOX_RCLONE_TPSLIMIT` | Max requests-per-second issued by the TB rclone mount. TB rate-limits reads aggressively under concurrent Plex/Bazarr scans; capping tps avoids the `too many errors 11/10` 429 cascade. Set to `0` to omit the flag entirely. | `5` |
| `TORBOX_RCLONE_TPSLIMIT_BURST` | Short-burst allowance on top of `TORBOX_RCLONE_TPSLIMIT`. Lets quick peeks (ffprobe header reads) succeed without blocking. Set to `0` to omit the flag entirely. Lowered from `10` to `3` to avoid an N-way burst tripping TorBox's WebDAV listing rate-limit. | `3` |
| `TORBOX_RCLONE_DIR_CACHE_TIME` | How long the TB rclone mount caches directory listings (rclone `--dir-cache-time` syntax, e.g. `2h`). Must exceed `LIBRARY_SCAN_INTERVAL`; with a shorter value every cold scan re-lists all TB folders at the throttled tps limit and times out, dropping TB titles (they show as "Wanted"). The blackhole grab hook calls `vfs/refresh`, so newly-grabbed content still appears between expiries. | `2h` |
| `TORBOX_SCAN_TIMEOUT` | Seconds the library scan may spend walking the TB FUSE mount, separate from the 30s main scan deadline. The main deadline cannot enumerate a large TB mount on a cold cache at the throttled tps limit (~450 folders ≈ 90s), so TB gets its own budget. Raise it if a very large TB library still truncates. | `180` |

> **Note**: plex_debrid (`PD_ENABLED=true`) speaks directly to RD via its
> own client and bypasses pd_zurg's blackhole entirely — multi-debrid
> routing therefore does not apply to plex_debrid-driven grabs.

## plex_debrid (watchlist automation)

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `PD_ENABLED` | Enable plex_debrid | `false` |
| `PLEX_USER` | Plex username | |
| `PLEX_TOKEN` | Plex token | |
| `PLEX_ADDRESS` | Plex server URL. Must include scheme, no trailing `/` | |
| `JF_ADDRESS` | Jellyfin/Emby URL (alternative to Plex) | |
| `JF_API_KEY` | Jellyfin/Emby API key | |
| `SEERR_API_KEY` | Overseerr/Jellyseerr API key | |
| `SEERR_ADDRESS` | Overseerr/Jellyseerr URL | |
| `SHOW_MENU` | Show plex_debrid interactive menu on startup | `true` |
| `PD_UPDATE` | Auto-update plex_debrid. Requires `PD_REPO` | `false` |
| `PD_REPO` | Update repo in `user,repo,branch` form | |
| `PD_LOG_LEVEL` | Log level (`DEBUG`/`INFO`/`OFF`) | `INFO` |
| `PD_LOGFILE` | Path for plex_debrid log output | |
| `TRAKT_CLIENT_ID` | Trakt API client ID (uses upstream default if unset) | |
| `TRAKT_CLIENT_SECRET` | Trakt API client secret | |
| `FLARESOLVERR_URL` | [FlareSolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr) URL for Cloudflare-protected indexers | |
| `PD_ENFORCE_CACHED_VERSIONS` | On startup, add a "cache-required" rule to every plex_debrid content version missing it. Stops uncached fallback grabs. Idempotent. **Recommended ON for RD users** — see [TROUBLESHOOTING](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#dmm-shows-torrents-at-0--with-no-seeds) | `false` |

---

## Plex library management

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `PLEX_REFRESH` | Auto-refresh Plex libraries. Enables both Zurg's `on_library_update` hook (RealDebrid content) and the library scanner's Plex section refresh after it symlinks new debrid content (covers TorBox/scanner-delivered titles). Requires `PLEX_ADDRESS` and `PLEX_TOKEN`. | `false` |
| `PLEX_MOUNT_DIR` | Mount path as Plex sees it (for library refresh) | |
| `DUPLICATE_CLEANUP` | Automated Plex duplicate detection + cleanup | `false` |
| `CLEANUP_INTERVAL` | Hours between duplicate cleanup runs | `24` |
| `DUPLICATE_CLEANUP_KEEP` | `local` (logs Zurg dupes) or `zurg` (deletes local copy) | `local` |
| `AUTO_UPDATE_INTERVAL` | Hours between auto-update checks | `24` |

---

## Blackhole (Sonarr/Radarr integration)

See the [Blackhole Symlink Guide](BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_GUIDE.md) for full setup.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `BLACKHOLE_ENABLED` | Enable blackhole watch folder | `false` |
| `BLACKHOLE_DIR` | Watch dir for `.torrent`/`.magnet`. Supports per-arr label subdirs (`sonarr/`, `radarr/`) — see the [Blackhole Guide](BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_GUIDE.md) | `/watch` |
| `BLACKHOLE_POLL_INTERVAL` | Seconds between folder scans | `5` |
| `BLACKHOLE_DEBRID` | Legacy: single debrid for all grabs (`realdebrid`/`alldebrid`/`torbox`). Auto-detected if unset. Superseded by `BLACKHOLE_DEBRID_PRIMARY` when both are set. | auto |
| `BLACKHOLE_DEBRID_ROUTING` | Per-grab routing (plan 39): `cache_aware` (probe both, prefer cached side) or `primary_only` (ignore cache, always use primary). When unset: `cache_aware` if two or more debrids configured, `primary_only` otherwise. | auto |
| `BLACKHOLE_DEBRID_PRIMARY` | Primary debrid for fallback / tiebreak in cache_aware mode. Defaults to first-configured-of `realdebrid`, `alldebrid`, `torbox`. | auto |
| `BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_TARGET_BASE_TORBOX` | Host path for TorBox-routed symlinks. Distinct from `BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_TARGET_BASE` so Plex sees TorBox content as a separate library (plan 39 Q1). Defaults to `<BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_TARGET_BASE>_torbox`. | auto |
| `BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_ENABLED` | Enable symlink creation after download | `false` |
| `BLACKHOLE_COMPLETED_DIR` | Staging directory for completed symlinks. Under per-arr label layout, symlinks are nested (`.../sonarr/`, `.../radarr/`). Flat layout works when no label subdirs | `/completed` |
| `BLACKHOLE_RCLONE_MOUNT` | rclone mount path inside the container. Append mount name (e.g. `/data/zurgarr`) | `/data` |
| `BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_TARGET_BASE` | Mount path as seen by Plex/Sonarr/Radarr hosts. **Required** for symlink mode | |
| `BLACKHOLE_MOUNT_POLL_TIMEOUT` | Max seconds to wait for content on mount | `300` |
| `BLACKHOLE_MOUNT_POLL_INTERVAL` | Seconds between mount checks | `10` |
| `BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_MAX_AGE` | Hours before old symlinks are cleaned up | `72` |
| `SYMLINK_REPAIR_AUTO_SEARCH` | Trigger arr re-search when a broken symlink can't be repaired from mount | `false` |

### Local-library dedup (skip content you already have)

Compares the torrent name against files already in a local library path.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `BLACKHOLE_DEDUP_ENABLED` | Skip torrents that match content in the local library | `false` |
| `BLACKHOLE_LOCAL_LIBRARY_TV` | Container path to TV library | |
| `BLACKHOLE_LOCAL_LIBRARY_MOVIES` | Container path to movie library | |

### Debrid-account dedup + cache gate

Different from local-library dedup — these gate the add on the debrid
account itself. See
[TROUBLESHOOTING](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#dmm-shows-torrents-at-0--with-no-seeds)
for recommended settings per provider.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `BLACKHOLE_DEBRID_DEDUP_ENABLED` | Skip if the hash is already on the debrid account. Stops Sonarr/Radarr re-grabs from producing duplicate entries in DMM | `true` |
| `BLACKHOLE_REQUIRE_CACHED` | Refuse `.torrent`/`.magnet` drops that aren't confirmed cached. **RD users leave OFF** (RD deprecated its cache probe Nov 2024); AD/TB users can turn this ON | `false` |
| `BLACKHOLE_DELETE_UNCACHED_ON_TIMEOUT` | When the blackhole gives up waiting for debrid to cache a torrent (`BLACKHOLE_MOUNT_POLL_TIMEOUT`), actively delete it from the debrid account instead of leaving it as a 0%/0-seed entry. **Recommended ON for RD users** — see [TROUBLESHOOTING](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#uncached-torrents-pile-up-on-my-debrid-account-from-the-blackhole) | `false` |
| `BLACKHOLE_TB_ALT_RECOVERY_ENABLED` | When a grabbed release is uncached and would be rejected, search Torrentio for other releases of the same title cached on **TorBox** (at the same quality tier the arr approved) and grab one instead. Stops well-cached titles falling to "Wanted" because the specific hash Sonarr/Radarr picked is uncached. Requires TorBox configured; no-op without it | `true` |
| `BLACKHOLE_TB_ALT_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | Cached-alternative grabs for one season before giving up and letting the title fall back to "Wanted". Each grab re-arms TorBox's abuse cooldown, so this caps re-grabbing a never-completing title on every `.magnet` re-drop. Persists across restarts; decays after 30 idle days | `12` |
| `BLACKHOLE_ARR_FAILED_FEEDBACK_ENABLED` | When an uncached grab is rejected (and no cached alternative was found), report the failure back to Sonarr/Radarr via the failed-download API so the arr blocklists that release and immediately searches for a different one. Without feedback the arr is never told anything went wrong and re-grabs the identical release on every RSS pass | `true` |
| `BLACKHOLE_ARR_FEEDBACK_MAX_STRIKES` | Failed-download reports per title (per episode for TV) before giving up. Each report makes the arr blocklist a release and grab the next candidate, so an entirely-uncached title would otherwise walk its whole release list. Past the cap, rejects fall back to silent deletion and the Wanted recovery pass owns the title. Persists across restarts; decays after 30 idle days | `8` |

### Quality compromise + season-pack fallback (opt-in)

Cache-aware tier escalation for strict Sonarr/Radarr profiles.
`QUALITY_COMPROMISE_ENABLED` is the master switch — every other variable
here is inert while it's OFF.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `QUALITY_COMPROMISE_ENABLED` | Master toggle — enables the rest of this section | `false` |
| `QUALITY_COMPROMISE_DWELL_DAYS` | Days at the preferred tier before the first compromise may fire (1–30) | `3` |
| `QUALITY_COMPROMISE_MIN_SEEDERS` | Seeder floor for compromise candidates (0–1000) | `3` |
| `QUALITY_COMPROMISE_ONLY_CACHED` | Require cached on debrid. RD users under strict mode will never compromise — flip OFF for aggressive escalation, or use AD/TB | `true` |
| `QUALITY_COMPROMISE_MAX_TIER_DROP` | Max tiers below preferred the engine may descend (1–10; 10≈unlimited — profile still the ceiling) | `2` |
| `QUALITY_COMPROMISE_NOTIFY` | Apprise notification on each compromise grab. OFF silences Apprise only — dashboard + history still fire | `true` |
| `SEASON_PACK_FALLBACK_ENABLED` | TV-only: probe a cached pack at the preferred tier before any tier drop | `false` |
| `SEASON_PACK_FALLBACK_MIN_MISSING` | Min missing-episode count before a pack probe (1–100) | `4` |
| `SEASON_PACK_FALLBACK_MIN_RATIO` | Min missing/total ratio (0.0–1.0; 0.0 disables) | `0.4` |

---

## Debrid search UI (interactive torrent search)

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `TORRENTIO_URL` | Torrentio API base URL (e.g. `https://torrentio.strem.fun`). Enables interactive search in the Library detail view with cache annotations and one-click add | |
| `PROWLARR_URL` | Prowlarr base URL (e.g. `http://prowlarr:9696`). With `PROWLARR_API_KEY` set, manual search merges results from every indexer configured in Prowlarr, and the Wanted recovery pass falls back to them when Torrentio has nothing usable for a title. Only torrent results carrying an infohash are used (hashless results are skipped and counted in the log) | |
| `PROWLARR_API_KEY` | Prowlarr API key (Prowlarr → Settings → General → Security). Sent as a request header, never in URLs. Also drives the Prowlarr tile on the Status page, which probes an authenticated endpoint — a dead key shows red | |
| `SEARCH_DEDUP_ENABLED` | Before submitting an "Add" click, check the account and refuse duplicates | `true` |
| `SEARCH_REQUIRE_CACHED` | Refuse the Add button when the hash isn't confirmed cached. Same RD caveat as `BLACKHOLE_REQUIRE_CACHED` — leave OFF on RD | `false` |

---

## Debrid health reconciler

Background sweep that probes each Real-Debrid torrent for the **May 2026 keyword filter-gate** (RD returns `infringing_file` / error 35 for cached torrents whose filenames trip its keyword blocklist — `WEB-DL`, `AMZN`, `[RARBG]`, etc.). Without this, Zurg's WebDAV listing keeps showing blocked torrents as healthy and your library renders phantom content that won't play. State is persisted to `/config/debrid_health.json`.

**Real-Debrid only.** AllDebrid and TorBox don't currently filter cached content this way, so the reconciler is gated on `RD_API_KEY` being configured — if you only have AD/TB credentials, the task never registers and the sweep never runs (zero overhead). The architecture has a multi-debrid extension hook (per plan 38), so adding AD/TB support if either provider ever introduces a similar filter is one method per provider.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `DEBRID_HEALTH_ENABLED` | Master kill switch for the periodic probe sweep. Turn OFF only if RD's API drifts and the prober misbehaves, or to silence background API calls entirely | `true` |
| `DEBRID_HEALTH_AUTO_REMEDIATE` | When a probe confirms a torrent is filter-blocked: blocklist the hash, delete from RD, trigger Sonarr/Radarr re-search. OFF by default because this mutates your RD account state. Hard-capped at 100 remediations per sweep so first-run enable cannot mass-delete | `false` |
| `DEBRID_HEALTH_CROSS_RESCUE` | Plan 39 phase 3: when RD filter-blocks a torrent that TorBox has cached, auto-rehost on TB (no blocklist, no RD delete, no arr re-search) and retarget arr-library symlinks to the TB mount. Skipped silently when TB doesn't have it cached or the add never reaches `completed` (60 s budget) — the existing remediation pipeline then runs as if rescue wasn't configured. Defaults to ON when both RD and TB API keys are configured; OFF when only one. Set explicit `true`/`false` to override. | auto |

| `DEBRID_QUOTA_ENABLED` | Debrid quota/expiry dashboard: periodic read-only poll of each configured provider for account expiry, storage usage (torrent count + total bytes), and near-expiry torrents (TorBox exposes per-torrent `expires_at`; Real-Debrid/AllDebrid have no per-torrent equivalent, so their cards carry account + storage only). Surfaces System-page cards, `zurgarr_debrid_*` Prometheus gauges, and a change-gated `debrid_expiry_warning` notification. Never mutates debrid state | `true` |
| `DEBRID_EXPIRY_WARN_DAYS` | Warning window: torrents expiring within this many days (and accounts this close to expiration) enter the warning set. The notification re-fires only when the set changes — a ticking countdown alone never re-notifies | `7` |

Sweep cadences (`DEBRID_HEALTH_INTERVAL`, default 12h; `DEBRID_QUOTA_INTERVAL`, default 6h) are power-user overrides read directly from env and not surfaced in the Settings UI. Per-torrent re-probe TTL (7 d for healthy), rate limit (60/min, well under RD's 250/min user quota), sweep cap (2000 probes per run), and remediation cap (100 deletes per run) are intentionally hardcoded module constants to keep the env surface minimal — open a feature request if you actually need to tune one.

**Recommended rollout when enabling auto-remediate**: Leave `DEBRID_HEALTH_ENABLED=true` and `DEBRID_HEALTH_AUTO_REMEDIATE=false` for at least one sweep (12 h). Inspect `/config/debrid_health.json` (entries with `status: "blocked"`) and confirm the kill list looks right. Then flip auto-remediate ON. Subsequent sweeps will batch-process blocked entries (≤100 per sweep) — for a large backlog, this takes several sweeps to drain. Each remediation produces an Activity-feed entry with cause `debrid_filtered`; a single per-sweep summary notification fires under the `debrid_filtered` event (subscribe via `NOTIFICATION_EVENTS`).

**Media recovery snapshots**: the hourly library scan records a once-per-day data point of library composition (debrid-playable / local-only / wanted, counted per movie and per episode) plus filter-gate deltas to `/config/recovery_snapshots.json`, queryable at `GET /api/recovery`. Retention is `RECOVERY_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 365) — a power-user override read directly from env, not surfaced in the Settings UI.

## Library browser, preferences, gap-fill

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `TMDB_API_KEY` | [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API key (free). Enables posters, episode titles, missing-episode detection, IMDb ID resolution | |
| `HISTORY_RETENTION_DAYS` | Days to keep activity history | `30` |
| `BLOCKLIST_AUTO_ADD` | Auto-blocklist torrents that hit terminal debrid errors, disc-rip rejection, or uncached-timeout failures | `true` |
| `BLOCKLIST_EXPIRY_DAYS` | Auto-expire auto-added blocklist entries after N days (0=never). Manual entries kept forever | `0` |
| `LIBRARY_PREFERENCE_AUTO_ENFORCE` | Auto-switch sources when content arrives matching a stored preference | `false` |
| `DEBRID_UNAVAILABLE_THRESHOLD_DAYS` | Days of failed searches before marking content debrid-unavailable | `3` |
| `FORCE_GRAB_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | Force-grabs of a debrid release for one stuck title before giving up (marks debrid-unavailable). Each force-grab re-arms TorBox's abuse cooldown, so this caps the self-inflicted churn. Persists across restarts; resets when the title lands on debrid or after 30 idle days | `12` |
| `PENDING_WARNING_HOURS` | Hours before `pending_warning` notification for stuck items (0 disables) | `24` |
| `GAP_FILL_ENABLED` | Reconcile monitored shows against TMDB and search Sonarr/Radarr for aired episodes missing from both sources. Also auto-enables `verify_symlinks` re-search on broken symlinks | `true` |
| `WANTED_TB_RECOVERY_ENABLED` | For each "Wanted" title the arr never grabbed, search Torrentio directly, probe TorBox's cache, and add the best cached release straight to TorBox — bypassing the arr's indexer pool. Closes the gap where a title is cached on TorBox but the arr never surfaces a grabbable release. With `PROWLARR_URL` configured, also falls back to Prowlarr's indexers when Torrentio has nothing usable (plus one rescue shot per given-up title). Requires TorBox + at least one search source (`TORRENTIO_URL` or `PROWLARR_URL`) | `true` |
| `WANTED_TB_RECOVERY_MAX_PER_SCAN` | Max Wanted titles the recovery pass adds to TorBox per library scan. Kept small so creates trickle across scans — create-volume bursts arm TorBox Essential's ~24h abuse cooldown, which starves recovery far more than a low cap | `2` |
| `WANTED_RD_RECOVERY_ENABLED` | RD leg of the Wanted recovery pass — a fallback that fires only on titles the TorBox cache probe reports uncached (or when TorBox can't answer this pass); TorBox-cached titles are claimed by the TorBox leg exclusively. RD's cache probe is dead, so the add is the probe: add the top release to RealDebrid, keep it if it goes instantly ready (cached), delete it otherwise. Shares the Prowlarr fallback with the TorBox leg. Requires RealDebrid + at least one search source | `true` |
| `WANTED_RD_RECOVERY_MAX_PER_SCAN` | Max RealDebrid probe-adds per library scan (attempts, not successes). RD has no create-volume cooldown, so this can sit higher than the TorBox cap; each uncached attempt burns up to ~20s of ready-polling | `4` |
| `WANTED_SEASON_RECOVERY_ENABLED` | Extend Wanted recovery to partially-present shows: each season with missing aired episodes is probed for a TorBox-cached season pack (single-episode release for the first missing episode as fallback). One cached pack add fills every gap in the season — the symlink phase skips episodes already on disk. TorBox-only; shares `WANTED_TB_RECOVERY_MAX_PER_SCAN` with whole-title targets, which keep first claim. Requires `WANTED_TB_RECOVERY_ENABLED` | `true` |

---

## Media services (Sonarr/Radarr)

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `SONARR_URL` | Sonarr base URL (e.g. `http://sonarr:8989`) | |
| `SONARR_API_KEY` | Sonarr API key | |
| `RADARR_URL` | Radarr base URL (e.g. `http://radarr:7878`) | |
| `RADARR_API_KEY` | Radarr API key | |
| `ROUTING_AUTO_TAG_UNTAGGED` | During the routing audit, auto-apply the debrid tag to monitored Sonarr series / Radarr movies with no routing tag — self-heals Overseerr requests that arrive with empty tags | `true` |

---

## Status UI & monitoring

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `STATUS_UI_ENABLED` | Enable the status web dashboard | `false` |
| `STATUS_UI_PORT` | Dashboard port | `8080` |
| `STATUS_UI_AUTH` | `user:password`. **Required** for the settings editor | |
| `STATUS_UI_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated origins allowed to make state-changing requests when the dashboard is served behind a reverse proxy (e.g. `https://zurgarr.example.com`). Direct IP:port access needs no entry | (empty) |
| `FFPROBE_MONITOR_ENABLED` | Detect stuck ffprobe processes on debrid mounts | `true` |
| `FFPROBE_STUCK_TIMEOUT` | Seconds before ffprobe is considered stuck | `300` |
| `FFPROBE_POLL_INTERVAL` | Seconds between ffprobe monitor scans | `30` |

---

## Notifications

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `NOTIFICATION_URL` | [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) URL(s), comma-separated | |
| `NOTIFICATION_EVENTS` | Comma-separated event subscription (leave empty for all). Known events: `startup`, `shutdown`, `download_complete`, `download_error`, `library_refresh`, `symlink_created`, `symlink_failed`, `debrid_unavailable`, `local_fallback_triggered`, `blocklist_added`, `health_error`, `symlink_repaired`, `daily_digest`, `debrid_add_success`, `debrid_add_failed` | all |
| `NOTIFICATION_LEVEL` | Minimum severity: `info`, `warning`, `error` | `info` |
| `NOTIFICATION_DIGEST_ENABLED` | Daily summary instead of individual notifications | `false` |
| `NOTIFICATION_DIGEST_TIME` | When to send the digest (24h format) | `08:00` |

---

## Scheduled task intervals (advanced)

All intervals are in minutes unless noted. Defaults are tuned for
homelab-scale installs — most users don't need to touch these.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `ROUTING_AUDIT_INTERVAL` | Minutes between Sonarr/Radarr routing audits (debrid-tag self-heal) | `360` (6h) |
| `QUEUE_CLEANUP_INTERVAL` | Minutes between Sonarr/Radarr queue cleanup passes | `60` |
| `LIBRARY_SCAN_INTERVAL` | Minutes between library scans | `60` |
| `LIBRARY_RESCAN_NFS_DELAY` | Seconds to sleep between symlink creation and the immediate Sonarr/Radarr rescan trigger, to let an NFS attribute cache invalidate before the arr walks the share. `0` disables (default; correct for local-FS arr-side libraries). Bump to `30` when symptomatic — see TROUBLESHOOTING for "Sonarr says hasFile=false right after a scan but imports correctly a minute later". Clamped to `[0, 300]`. | `0` |
| `SYMLINK_VERIFY_INTERVAL` | Minutes between symlink verification sweeps | `360` (6h) |
| `PREFERENCE_ENFORCE_INTERVAL` | Minutes between preference-enforcement passes | `60` |
| `HOUSEKEEPING_INTERVAL` | Minutes between housekeeping (history prune, cache rotation) | `1440` (24h) |
| `CONFIG_BACKUP_INTERVAL` | Seconds between scheduled config backups (archive of `.env`, `settings.json`, `library_prefs.json`, `blocklist.json`). `0` disables scheduled backups — manual backup/restore in the Settings UI still work | `86400` (24h) |
| `CONFIG_BACKUP_RETENTION` | Number of scheduled backup archives to retain. Older ones are pruned after each run | `7` |
| `CONFIG_BACKUP_DIR` | Directory that receives scheduled backup archives. Pre-restore snapshots also land here (under `pre-restore-<timestamp>/` subdirs) | `/config/backups` |
| `MOUNT_LIVENESS_INTERVAL` | Minutes between rclone mount liveness probes | `5` |
| `MOUNT_SELFHEAL_ENABLED` | When the liveness probe finds a dead FUSE mount (stale mount-table entry after a container recreate — rclone crashloops on "directory already mounted"), automatically lazy-unmount the corpse and restart the owning rclone process. Fires only after 2 consecutive dead probes, only for the dead-daemon signature (never a merely slow or rate-limited mount), at most once per 10 minutes per mount. Also retries mounts that were *skipped at startup* because their WebDAV endpoint was unreachable (e.g. container started before the host network was ready) — first retry immediate, then at most once per 10 minutes per mount, until the mount comes up. Set `false` to require manual recovery | `true` |

|---|---|---|
| `ZURGARR_LOG_LEVEL` | [Zurgarr log level](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels) | `INFO` |
| `ZURGARR_LOG_COUNT` | Rotated log files to retain | `2` |
| `ZURGARR_LOG_SIZE` | Max log file size before rotation (`K`/`M`/`G`) | `10M` |
| `COLOR_LOG_ENABLED` | Colored console output | `false` |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | [GitHub token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) — avoids rate limits, required for Zurg nightly | |
| `SKIP_VALIDATION` | Skip startup config validation | `false` |

## Docker secrets

Zurgarr reads sensitive values from `/run/secrets/<name>` when the env
var isn't set. Supported names: `github_token`, `rd_api_key`,
`ad_api_key`, `torbox_api_key`, `plex_user`, `plex_token`,
`plex_address`, `jf_api_key`, `jf_address`, `seerr_api_key`,
`seerr_address`.

```yaml
services:
  zurgarr:
    image: zurgarr:latest
    secrets:
      - rd_api_key
      - plex_token

secrets:
  rd_api_key:
    file: ./secrets/rd_api_key.txt
  plex_token:
    file: ./secrets/plex_token.txt
```

Remove the corresponding env vars from `.env` when using secrets.

## Data volumes

| Container path | Permissions | Description |
|---|:---:|---|
| `/config` | rw | rclone.conf, plex_debrid settings.json, persistent state. `rclone.conf` is overwritten on start — don't share with other rclone instances |
| `/log` | rw | Log files |
| `/cache` | rw | rclone VFS cache (when `RCLONE_VFS_CACHE_MODE` is set) |
| `/data` | rshared | rclone mount point. Not needed if only using plex_debrid |
| `/zurg/RD` | rw | Zurg Real-Debrid state |
| `/zurg/AD` | rw | Zurg AllDebrid state |
| `/watch` | rw | Blackhole watch folder (only when `BLACKHOLE_ENABLED=true`) |
| `/completed` | rw | Completed symlinks (only when `BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_ENABLED=true`) |
