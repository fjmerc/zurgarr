## Version [2.14.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- **Usenet-preferred local routing**: "Prefer Local" now routes downloads exclusively through usenet clients (NZBget/SABnzbd) when available, using a dedicated `usenet` tag. Falls back to any local client if no usenet client is configured. Usenet indexers are tagged with both `local` and `usenet` tags to support both routing modes.
- **Download client routing**: Automatically routes downloads through debrid or local download clients in Sonarr/Radarr based on source preference. Auto-tags untagged download clients, tags usenet indexers with local tag, and manages dual-tag exclusivity to prevent debrid interception of local downloads.
- **Sonarr-style poster cards**: Library browser now shows poster images with progress bars, replacing the plain list view. Includes TMDB metadata enrichment for poster artwork.
- **TMDB dedup and alias merge**: Debrid entries sharing a TMDB ID but with different parsed titles (e.g. "Andor" vs "Star Wars Andor") are deduplicated. Cross-source merge now uses TMDB IDs to match debrid and local items even when titles differ. TMDB disambiguation used when adding shows/movies to Sonarr/Radarr.
- **Alphabetical jump bar**: Library browser includes an A-Z jump bar that scales dynamically with viewport height for quick navigation through large libraries.
- **Centralized task scheduler**: Background task scheduler with WebUI for periodic maintenance tasks (library scan, symlink verification, duplicate cleanup) with configurable intervals.
- **Prefer-debrid active search**: Titles with prefer-debrid preference now actively search Sonarr/Radarr for debrid copies of local-only episodes, with search budgets and cooldown to avoid API spam.
- **Auto-retry alternative releases**: Blackhole automatically retries with alternative releases when a debrid provider rejects a torrent, and detects stale grabs that never completed.
- **Episode-aware blackhole dedup**: Deduplication now checks at the episode level instead of season level, preventing false positives when only some episodes exist locally.
- **Fuzzy title matching**: Debrid symlink creation uses fuzzy/normalized title matching for arr folder names, handling punctuation differences like "(500) Days of Summer" vs "500 Days of Summer".
- **Library UI overhaul**: 13 improvements inspired by Overseerr, Sonarr, and Maintainerr — including preference help text formatting, pending badge state distinction (migrating vs searching), and missing env vars added to Settings UI.
- **Direct WebDAV scanning**: Library scanner now queries Zurg's WebDAV API directly via PROPFIND, bypassing the FUSE/rclone mount for directory enumeration. Reduces mount scan time from 10-20 seconds to under 1 second. Falls back to FUSE scanning automatically if Zurg is unreachable.
- **Smart refresh polling**: Library refresh button now polls the backend until the scan completes, replacing the fixed 3-second delay. Shows a scanning indicator and updates the UI automatically when data is ready. Includes error feedback for timeouts and server failures.

### Changed

- **Split scan architecture**: Library scan is now split into a fast read-only phase (mount enumeration, cross-referencing, TMDB enrichment) and a background effects phase (preference enforcement, arr searches, symlink creation). The UI receives fresh library data after the read phase completes (~1-5s) while effects continue running in the background (~30-60s).
- **Season pack preference**: Scanner now prefers season pack files over individual episode downloads, using per-season episode count to avoid lower-quality mega-packs beating higher-quality season packs.
- **Fresh preferences**: `/api/library` response always returns preferences fresh from disk instead of using stale scan-time values.
- **Concurrent scan protection**: Added `_effects_running` guard to prevent overlapping preference enforcement and arr API calls from concurrent refresh requests.
- **Cache safety**: API responses now use a shallow copy of cached scan data to prevent mutation of the shared cache object across concurrent requests.
- **Stale cache during scan**: `get_data()` returns stale cached data when a background scan is running instead of triggering a duplicate synchronous scan.
- **Grid re-render optimization**: Smart poll skips full grid re-render to prevent poster image flicker during background data updates.

### Fixed

- **Indexer routing**: Debrid tag now applied to torrent indexers, and re-search triggered for missing content after routing changes.
- **Library scanner rescans**: Fixed rescan triggers and improved symlink target path validation to reject paths outside the mount.
- **False 'both' source**: Debrid symlinks in local library scan no longer cause false 'both' source classification. Expanded `verify_symlinks` to check local library directories.
- **Title parsing**: Filter non-media folders (plex versions, subs, featurettes), fix empty parentheses in titles, and prevent MAX title corruption from quality pattern over-matching.
- **RD torrent monitoring**: Fixed monitor polling deleted RD torrents and accept `selectFiles` 202 status responses.
- **Alt-retry race condition**: Hardened failure paths in automatic alternative release retry logic.
- **Episode dedup regex**: Updated to handle Sonarr-standard naming patterns (S01E01 format).
- **Download routing e2e**: Fixed usenet client skipping, indexer downloadClientId override clearing, and stale unavailable queue item cleanup.
- **Stale pending entries**: Auto-clear pending entries for titles removed from the library.
- **TMDB year-filter search failure**: TMDB searches with a year filter now retry without the year when the filtered search returns no results. Fixes shows like "Marvel's Spidey and His Amazing Friends" where the folder year (season air date) doesn't match the show's premiere year, preventing TMDB caching and alias-based dedup.
- **WebDAV scanner Zurg compatibility**: WebDAV PROPFIND scanner now handles both absolute (`/dav/movies/...`) and relative (`folder/file`) hrefs from Zurg. Also detects when Zurg doesn't support recursive depth-infinity PROPFIND (returns folders without files) and falls back to FUSE mount scanning automatically.
- **Stale debrid symlink cleanup**: `verify_symlinks` now checks symlinks pointing to `BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_TARGET_BASE` (e.g. `/mnt/debrid/`) in addition to the rclone mount path. Previously only checked the mount path, so symlinks created with a different target base were never cleaned up when torrents expired.
- **Faster debrid library on startup**: When the rclone mount appears after the initial scan has already started, the scanner now automatically triggers a follow-up scan so debrid content appears within seconds instead of waiting for the next scheduled scan (up to 2 minutes).
- **Title parsing for mid-string year**: Folder names like `Movie (2000) DC (1080p BluRay...)` now correctly extract the year before quality truncation, preventing mangled titles like `Movie (2000) DC (1080p` and duplicate library entries without posters.
- **Symlink creation guard for empty local library**: Debrid symlink creation now skips when the local library scan found zero local content, preventing symlink pollution when network mounts (NFS/SMB) aren't propagated into the container.
- **TMDB year-preference matching**: TMDB search now prefers results whose release year matches the folder year instead of blindly taking the first (most popular) result. Only activates when the top result is >2 years off (avoiding false corrections from season air years), limits scan to top 5 results, and skips year preference entirely on fallback-no-year retries. Fixes movies like "Cover Up (2025)" incorrectly showing the poster and metadata for the 1983 French film "La Crime".

## Version [2.13.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- **Auto-create debrid symlinks**: When `BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_ENABLED=true` and local library paths are configured, the library scanner automatically creates organized symlinks in the local TV/movie library for debrid-only content. Sonarr/Radarr can then discover content that only exists on the debrid mount without manual import. Symlinks use canonical arr folder names when available.
- **Sonarr/Radarr rescan triggers**: After creating debrid symlinks, automatically triggers disk rescans in Sonarr (RescanSeries) and Radarr (RescanMovie) so they pick up new files without manual intervention.
- **Sonarr-inspired episode list UX**: Seasons sorted newest-first, color-coded progress pills (green=complete, yellow=partial, gray=empty), Expand All / Collapse All button, collapse footer on long seasons, formatted air dates (e.g., "Mar 15, 2025").
- **Pending state auto-cleanup**: Every library scan checks pending "Switching to debrid/local" entries against actual episode sources and clears resolved ones, even for manual changes outside the app.

### Fixed

- **Stale pending badges**: "Switching to debrid" badges persisted forever because switch-to-debrid and remove-local endpoints never cleared pending state. Now cleared immediately after successful operations.
- **applyMoviePreference prefer-debrid path**: Missing `_actionInFlight` guard and error recovery caused buttons to get permanently disabled after network failures.
- **Keydown listener leak**: Debrid removal confirmation dialog leaked keyboard event listeners when the DOM was destroyed by navigation or re-render.
- **Log file selection**: `read_log_lines` picked log files by mtime (unreliable for same-second writes), now uses lexicographic sort on date-stamped filenames.
- **Thread safety**: `get_all_pending()` now acquires `_pending_lock` for consistent reads.
- **Direction validation**: `set_pending()` rejects invalid direction values to prevent permanently stale entries.
- **XSS hardening**: Season numbers escaped in data attributes, log messages use `%r` formatting.

## Version [2.12.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- **Web-based settings editor**: Browser-based configuration for pd_zurg environment variables and plex_debrid settings.json with proper input types, inline validation, and SIGHUP reload (no container restart needed)
- **Quality profile editor**: JSON editor for plex_debrid quality profiles with first-run setup experience
- **OAuth device code flows**: Connect Trakt, Debrid Link, Put.io, and Orionoid accounts directly from the settings editor
- **Settings import/export**: Download or upload .env and settings files for backup and migration
- **Blackhole symlink mode**: Creates symlinks from completed debrid downloads to a target directory for Sonarr/Radarr import — zero-copy, no local storage used
- **Local library dedup**: Checks existing TV/movie library before submitting torrents to debrid to avoid duplicate downloads (`BLACKHOLE_DEDUP_ENABLED`)
- **RD account dedup**: Deduplicates incoming torrents against existing Real-Debrid account torrents before submitting
- **Workflow diagrams**: Interactive "How it works" diagrams in the status dashboard showing Watchlist and Arr+Blackhole flows with component glossary
- **Status UI enhancements**: Log viewer with level filtering, process restart buttons, running config viewer, mount event history
- **Service health checks**: Dashboard shows connectivity status and premium expiry for debrid, Plex, Overseerr, and other integrated services
- **Config validation**: Startup validation of environment variables with clear error messages
- **SIGHUP reload**: Reload pd_zurg configuration without restarting the container
- **.env import button**: Restore configuration from a previously exported .env file via the settings editor
- **Bidirectional settings sync**: Changes in .env propagate to plex_debrid settings.json and vice versa
- **DUPLICATE_CLEANUP_KEEP**: New option to control which copy is kept during duplicate cleanup — `local` (default, logs Zurg dupes) or `zurg` (deletes local copy)

### Changed

- `.env` is now the single source of configuration — docker-compose.yml no longer contains inline env vars, making it safe to pull updates without losing settings
- Duplicate cleanup reworked: skips Zurg copies by default (read-only mount), logs summary at INFO level with per-item detail at DEBUG
- NFS mode documented as not creating a local mount — cross-machine WebDAV setup recommended instead

### Fixed

- `atomic_write()` crash from invalid kwargs passed to `mkstemp()`
- Auth lockout: StatusHandler credentials now update on SIGHUP reload
- Phantom AllDebrid instance created when only Real-Debrid is configured
- False Plex/Jellyfin conflict error during startup validation

- `SimpleNamespace` missing `.status` attribute crash in RD torrent info handling
- Environment variables overridden by stale `/config/.env` on container restart
- Log viewer stuck displaying rotated log file after log rotation
- Single-file torrent extension mismatch in blackhole symlinks
- Stale config after SIGHUP reload, missing service triggers, and settings sync gaps
- JS syntax error in status UI restart button handler
- Dashboard layout issues: header spacing, column alignment, stat centering


## Version [2.11.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added

- **Process auto-restart**: Crashed processes are automatically detected and restarted with exponential backoff (5s → 300s), sliding window restart counting, and max restart limits
- **Zombie reaping**: `SIGCHLD` set to `SIG_IGN` for automatic kernel-level zombie child reaping without conflicting with subprocess management
- **Apprise notifications**: Event-driven notifications to 90+ services (Discord, Telegram, Slack, email, etc.) via `NOTIFICATION_URL` environment variable, with event and severity filtering
- **Blackhole watch folder**: Arr-stack compatible watch directory for `.torrent` and `.magnet` files with Real-Debrid, AllDebrid, and TorBox support. Failed files quarantined to `failed/` subdirectory
- **ffprobe stuck-process recovery**: Monitors for ffprobe processes stuck in uninterruptible sleep on debrid mounts, attempts recovery via I/O poke, then kills after max attempts
- **Status Web UI**: Lightweight dashboard at `/status` with JSON API at `/api/status`, showing process health, mount status, cgroup-aware system stats, and recent events. Optional basic auth
- **MDBList content source**: Subscribe to curated MDBList lists (IMDB Top 250, trending, custom) that feed plex_debrid's download pipeline. Configure via plex_debrid settings menu
- **Atomic config writes**: Zurg config.yml and rclone.config updates use temp-file-then-rename to prevent corruption on crash
- **Wait-for-URL with exponential backoff**: Extracted generic `wait_for_url()` utility from rclone module with 5s → 60s exponential backoff
- **Ordered shutdown**: Per-process shutdown timeouts (plex_debrid: 15s, Zurg/rclone: 10s) with elapsed time logging

### Changed

- Process registry changed from tuples to dicts for extensibility
- `stop_process()` now disables auto-restart to prevent spurious restarts during update cycles
- Shutdown notification sent after critical cleanup with 5s timeout thread

## Version [2.10.0] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed

- Torrentio: Fixed `qualityfilter` parameter format for current Torrentio API
- Error handling: Replaced bare `except: pass` in main.py that silently swallowed all exceptions including SystemExit and KeyboardInterrupt
- Error handling: Flattened 3-4 levels of nested try/except that re-wrapped exceptions and lost tracebacks
- Healthcheck: Removed redundant in-process healthcheck subprocess loop (Dockerfile HEALTHCHECK already handles this)
- Thread safety: Fixed SubprocessLogger thread join hangs by checking stop_event in read loops and adding join timeouts

### Added

- FLARESOLVERR_URL: Optional environment variable to enable FlareSolverr proxy for Torrentio scraping when Cloudflare protection blocks direct requests
- Graceful shutdown: All tracked child processes (Zurg, rclone, plex_debrid) are now terminated on SIGTERM/SIGINT before unmounting filesystems
