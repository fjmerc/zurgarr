## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **README tagline and positioning retuned to reflect the project's actual center of gravity (integration, not packaging)**: The old tagline — *"Stream your Real-Debrid library through Plex or Jellyfin — one container, zero local storage"* — described what the upstream pd_zurg project was: packaging glue for Zurg + rclone + plex_debrid. But the capabilities Zurgarr has accumulated since the fork (source-aware Library browser, auto debrid symlinks, source preference state, `to-any` pending direction, TMDB gap-fill across both backends, quality compromise engine, season-pack fallback, routing audit self-heal, symlink verify/repair, debrid-account dedup + cache gates) aren't "streaming through Plex" features — they're all structurally about *integrating and managing local + debrid media as one library*. The new tagline — *"Local media and debrid content, managed as one library — for Plex, Jellyfin, Sonarr, and Radarr"* — and the rewritten "What is Zurgarr?" paragraph lead with the integration layer while still crediting the Zurg/rclone/plex_debrid packaging foundation underneath. The "Why this project?" feature list, previously an unstructured bullet cloud ordered by commit history, is now grouped into five intent-based sections: **Unified library** (Library browser, auto symlinks, Torrentio search, cross-machine WebDAV exposure), **Sonarr/Radarr integration** (blackhole + quality compromise + season-pack fallback + gap-fill + debrid-account dedup & cache gates), **Self-healing** (routing audit auto-tag, symlink verify+repair, blocklist auto-expiry, ffprobe recovery, process auto-restart), **Observability & control** (dashboard + settings editor with SIGHUP reload, activity history, Apprise notifications, Prometheus metrics, OAuth device-code flows, MDBList), and **Reliability & non-disruption** (atomic config writes, ordered shutdown, Docker secrets, sidecar-to-existing-arr-stack posture). Capabilities that were previously underhighlighted or missing from the bullets (Prometheus metrics endpoint, activity history log, OAuth flows for Trakt/Debrid Link/Put.io/Orionoid, MDBList subscriptions, atomic config writes across all state surfaces, non-disruptive sidecar posture alongside qBit/Usenet) are now surfaced explicitly. Net: ~60 additional lines in the README's opening section, but much higher information density per line and a framing that matches what the codebase actually is.

- **Documentation restructured: README is now lean, config reference and troubleshooting are their own docs**: The single 548-line README tried to serve four audiences at once (curious browser, pd_zurg migrant, first-time installer, existing user tuning a knob) — a structural contradiction that no amount of rewriting fixes. Split into three docs with distinct audiences. `README.md` (~338 lines) keeps the intro, the quickstart, the three workflow recipes (watchlist / blackhole / both), the docker-compose examples, the web UI overview, and the credits/licensing — but **no config tables, no troubleshooting section**, and no deep-reference prose. A new one-paragraph "Recommended settings per debrid provider" block handles the most common reason a new user googles for help (uncached junk in DMM). New `CONFIGURATION.md` (~291 lines) is the full env-var reference, grouped by feature with proper headings instead of collapsed `<details>` sections; a new "Minimum required to start" table at the top answers "what's the least I have to set?" without making users scroll the full ~80-variable list. New `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (~172 lines) is symptom-first — entries are keyed by what the user sees ("DMM shows torrents at 0% with no seeds", "Duplicate torrents in my debrid account", "Sonarr/Radarr keeps re-grabbing the same failed torrent") rather than by setting, with a short fix and a link to the relevant CONFIGURATION.md section. The "Migrating from pd_zurg" guidance from the old README Troubleshooting section moved verbatim. The restructure also closed several gaps discovered during the audit: five new env vars from the dedup/cache-gates work (`SEARCH_DEDUP_ENABLED`, `SEARCH_REQUIRE_CACHED`, `BLACKHOLE_DEBRID_DEDUP_ENABLED`, `BLACKHOLE_REQUIRE_CACHED`, `PD_ENFORCE_CACHED_VERSIONS`) weren't documented in any user-facing doc and are now in CONFIGURATION.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md, and `.env.example`; eight scheduled-task intervals (`ROUTING_AUDIT_INTERVAL`, `QUEUE_CLEANUP_INTERVAL`, `LIBRARY_SCAN_INTERVAL`, `SYMLINK_VERIFY_INTERVAL`, `PREFERENCE_ENFORCE_INTERVAL`, `HOUSEKEEPING_INTERVAL`, `CONFIG_BACKUP_INTERVAL`, `MOUNT_LIVENESS_INTERVAL`) that the code has been reading for releases without any prose coverage now have a table in CONFIGURATION.md's "Scheduled task intervals" section; `ROUTING_AUTO_TAG_UNTAGGED` and `PD_LOGFILE` also joined the reference; the confusing `BLACKHOLE_DEDUP_ENABLED` vs new `BLACKHOLE_DEBRID_DEDUP_ENABLED` name collision is now explicitly called out in both the config table (two distinct sub-sections: "Local-library dedup" vs "Debrid-account dedup + cache gate") and the troubleshooting entry. CLAUDE.md's Documentation Map updated to describe each doc's purpose and adds a "When adding a new env var" checklist reminding contributors to update all four surfaces (`base/__init__.py`, `utils/settings_api.py`, `CONFIGURATION.md`, `.env.example`) so future drift is less likely. No code changes — all 1582 tests continue to pass.

### Added

- **Debrid-account dedup and "require cached" gates on both the manual search "Add" button and the Sonarr/Radarr blackhole**: Addresses two long-running pain points in the interactive + blackhole add paths — uncached torrents landing in the user's RD/AD/TB account as 0%/0-seed/0-B/s entries that DebridMediaManager then surfaces as unplayable junk, and duplicate hash submissions that create parallel torrent entries for the same release after a Sonarr/Radarr re-grab. `utils/search.py::add_to_debrid` (the one-click Add on the Library detail search UI) and `utils/blackhole.py::_process_file` (the `.torrent`/`.magnet` blackhole watcher) both gained two new gates that fire *before* the provider-specific add handler is invoked: a dedup probe that queries the debrid account's current hash set and short-circuits if the incoming hash is already present, and a cache-require probe that refuses the add when the provider's `/magnet/instant` (AD) / `/api/torrents/checkcached` (TB) cache probe does not confirm the hash is cached. Real-Debrid deprecated `/torrents/instantAvailability` in Nov 2024 so `check_debrid_cache` returns `None` (unknown) for every RD hash — strict mode treats `None` as "not cached" and refuses, matching the plex_debrid compromise engine's I4 invariant; users who run RD and still want the gate on AD/TB only should leave it OFF. Four new env vars — `SEARCH_DEDUP_ENABLED` (default **ON**), `SEARCH_REQUIRE_CACHED` (default OFF), `BLACKHOLE_DEBRID_DEDUP_ENABLED` (default **ON**), `BLACKHOLE_REQUIRE_CACHED` (default OFF) — all exposed in the Settings UI under Debrid Search and Blackhole respectively, and all registered in `utils/config_reload.py::SOFT_RELOAD` so SIGHUP applies toggle changes without bouncing the blackhole watcher or status server. The dedup probe is backed by a new `_existing_hashes(service, api_key)` helper in `utils/search.py` that calls RD `/torrents?limit=2500`, AD `/v4/magnet/status`, or TB `/v1/api/torrents/mylist` and caches the resulting lowercase hash set per service for 30s — a burst of "Add" clicks issues one list call, not N — with a matching `remember_added_hash(service, hash)` hook that primes the cache on successful add so a duplicate click within TTL is caught even before the account list is re-fetched. Cache-key invariants: `_existing_hashes` returns `None` (unknown) when the service/key is missing or the API errors, which both gates treat as "cannot dedup / cannot verify — proceed" rather than silently refusing; the strict cache-require gate, by contrast, treats `None` in the *blackhole* differently from the *search* path — in the blackhole a `None` means "API unavailable, leave the file in place so the next poll retries", because silently deleting every in-flight Sonarr/Radarr drop during a transient AD/TB outage is a data-loss path; in the search UI `None` refuses the add (user can retry). Only `cached is False` (provider-confirmed uncached) deletes the drop. A stricter-than-strict guard rejects any `.torrent`/`.magnet` whose info hash could not be extracted (corrupted bencode, missing `btih:`) when `BLACKHOLE_REQUIRE_CACHED` is ON — a malformed file cannot be cache-verified so it cannot be allowed through a safety gate; dedup-only mode still falls through for malformed files because dedup is best-effort. And a bypass for `BLACKHOLE_REQUIRE_CACHED=true` + missing `debrid_api_key` refuses to delete drops and logs an error instead, so a Docker-secrets mount failure or typo in `RD_API_KEY` surfaces as "please fix your config" rather than "every drop is silently eaten". A process-wide `_inflight_adds` set (guarded by `_existing_hashes_lock`) prevents the race where two concurrent `add_to_debrid` callers both pass the account-list dedup probe before either reaches `addMagnet` — the second caller sees the first's in-flight tuple and returns `{'duplicate': True, 'error': 'Add already in progress'}` without submitting. `_existing_hashes` now returns a snapshot (`set(cached[1])`) rather than the live cached reference so a concurrent `remember_added_hash` cannot mutate the set a caller is iterating. Dedup helpers are hardened against API shape drift via an `_coerce_hash(value)` type-guard that drops non-string `hash` fields (an int or null slipping through would otherwise raise `AttributeError` on `.strip()`), plus `isinstance(data, dict)` guards in the AD/TB helpers and `AttributeError/TypeError/KeyError` added to the `_existing_hashes` exception catch so a broken API response never bubbles up into the HTTP handler. A one-time warning fires when RD returns the full 2500-entry page — heavy users get a visible "dedup may miss older entries" log line instead of a silent-degradation failure mode. The blackhole path's `from utils.search import ...` is now unguarded (it's a first-party module; a bare `ImportError` silence was hiding real bugs) and uses `cache_label` instead of `label` to avoid shadowing the `_process_file(label=...)` routing-label parameter. The `PD_ENFORCE_CACHED_VERSIONS` migration (default OFF) hooks into `plex_debrid_/setup.py::pd_setup` via a new `enforce_cached_versions(json_data)` helper that the test suite now exercises directly — the previous hand-copied migration logic in the test file would have let a regression in the real code slip through unnoticed. The helper injects `["cache status", "requirement", "cached", ""]` as the first rule of any plex_debrid content version missing it, so the vendored `plex_debrid/debrid/services/{realdebrid,alldebrid,torbox}.py` download paths — which only reject uncached grabs when the content version *explicitly* requires cached — stop falling back to uncached releases for custom versions the user added via the plex_debrid UI. Idempotent: a no-op once the rule is present, safe to leave ON on every startup. Forty-four new tests in `tests/test_search.py` (30 — TestAddToDebridDedup, TestAddToDebridRequireCached, TestExistingHashesHelpers, TestAddToDebridInFlightRace) and `tests/test_blackhole_debrid_dedup.py` (14 — TestBlackholeDebridDedup, TestBlackholeRequireCached, TestPlexDebridCacheRuleEnforcer) cover every branch of each gate, including: the "unknown account state does not block" dedup invariant, the RD-specific "None means not cached" behaviour of the strict search gate, the "None means DEFER, do not delete" behaviour of the strict blackhole gate, the malformed-torrent refusal under strict mode, the missing-API-key bypass that preserves the drop, the concurrent-add in-flight rejection, the TTL cache hit/miss and force-refresh paths, the `remember_added_hash` post-add priming, API-shape-drift robustness (non-list RD, non-dict AD/TB, non-string hash fields), the RD truncation warning, and the migration's idempotency and "malformed versions are skipped, not crashed" robustness guard. All 1538 pre-existing tests continue to pass — total suite now 1582.

- **Unconditional episode-completeness reconcile ("available anywhere" gap-fill)**: The library scan now diffs every monitored show's aired TMDB episode list against the combined debrid + local source map and triggers a Sonarr/Radarr search for every aired episode missing from BOTH backends, regardless of whether the user set a `prefer-debrid` / `prefer-local` preference. Previously `_search_for_debrid_copies` only fired for shows explicitly tagged `prefer-debrid`, and even then it only searched episodes that existed locally but not on debrid — episodes missing from both sources were structurally invisible because the scanner's `season_data` only contains episodes with files (see `library.py:3589`). The renamed `_search_for_missing_episodes` builds the missing set from the TMDB cache (new `tmdb.get_cached_episode_list(title, year)`, aired-only, season-0 excluded) via a new `_compute_missing_episodes(show)` helper; the resulting `(season, episode)` tuples feed the existing per-season search plumbing (cooldown, `_SEARCH_RETRY_HOURS`, `_SEARCH_BUDGET_SECONDS`, touch-before-search). Route selection is driven by `_route_for(norm, preferences)`: `prefer-debrid` → `prefer_debrid=True` (legacy force-grab via interactive search, merged with the new missing-anywhere set so both intents fire in one pass); `prefer-local` → `False`; unset → `None` (Sonarr's existing routing tag decides the destination). New pending direction `to-any` is introduced for the route=None case, added to `_VALID_DIRECTIONS` in `utils/library_prefs.py`; `_clear_resolved_pending` resolves `to-any` entries on ANY source (debrid, local, or both) — the user story is "playable anywhere", not "playable via a specific route" — and `_escalate_stuck_pending` leaves `to-any` entries alone (no `debrid-unavailable` promotion: the episode may still land via either backend so we keep retrying at the existing 6h cadence rather than silently giving up). `ensure_and_search` gains a `respect_monitored=False` kwarg; the library reconcile passes `True` whenever route is None or False so an explicitly-unmonitored episode in Sonarr/Radarr is never re-searched against the user's intent. The legacy prefer-debrid code path keeps `respect_monitored=False` so existing behavior is byte-identical for users who already opted in. Parity with Radarr: the movies branch drops the preference gate too; missing movies are searched under whatever route the user picked, with the same `to-any`/`to-debrid`/`to-local` direction assignment; Radarr's `ensure_and_search` gets `respect_monitored` too — short-circuits with `status='skipped'` when the movie exists in Radarr but is unmonitored. Gated by the new `GAP_FILL_ENABLED` env var (default `true`): when set to `false`, the missing-anywhere path short-circuits but the legacy prefer-debrid local-only path stays unconditional so users who explicitly opted out of gap-fill don't lose their existing prefer-debrid enforcement. 23 new tests in `tests/test_gap_fill.py` and `tests/test_tmdb_episode_list.py` cover the route selector, the TMDB diff helper (including the empty-cache safety — an unknown title returns `[]` so reconcile doesn't hallucinate searches for a show with no ground truth), unset-preference searches, `to-any` direction resolution/non-escalation, preference-preserved behavior, gap-fill-off isolation, movie parity, and the `respect_monitored` split between routes. All 11 existing `test_search_retry.py` cases pass against the renamed function — the retry/cooldown/touch-before-search semantics are preserved verbatim.

- **Post-grab release completeness audit**: New `_audit_release_completeness(filename, release_name, mount_path, info)` hook runs after successful symlink creation in the blackhole flow (`_monitor_and_symlink` Phase 3). For episode-level releases where `_parse_episodes(filename)` returns a non-empty claimed set, the method walks the mount directory, parses episode numbers from each media file via `_parse_episodes`, and compares claimed vs delivered. On short delivery it logs a `release_incomplete` history event with the claimed/delivered/missing lists, blocklists the release's info_hash via `_blocklist.add(hash, filename, reason=..., source='auto')` so the same incomplete release isn't re-grabbed (respects `BLOCKLIST_AUTO_ADD`, default true), and triggers `ensure_and_search` for only the still-missing episode numbers with `prefer_debrid=True, respect_monitored=True` — the release routed through the blackhole so force-grab is the right shape, and respecting monitored prevents re-searching episodes the user unmonitored between grab and audit. Season packs (where `_parse_episodes` returns an empty set) are deliberately skipped at this layer: there's no reliable TMDB lookup inside the blackhole watcher and the library-scan reconcile already catches pack gaps on the next cycle. Partially-delivered episodes are never un-symlinked — partial playback beats nothing — so the failure mode is "release is blocklisted and missing episodes re-searched" rather than "completed directory is rolled back". Best-effort everywhere: hash extraction failure, history/blocklist failure, or re-search failure are all swallowed at DEBUG level so an audit error never breaks the happy-path symlink-created notification that already fired. Five new tests in `tests/test_blackhole_completeness.py` cover the complete-release no-op, the short-delivery blocklist path, the re-search-only-missing path (E5, E6 missing from a claimed E4-E6 range produces a `search_episodes([5, 6])` call with the correct season), the pack-release skip, and the missing-hash-still-logs-history fallback.

- **`verify_symlinks` auto-search now on by default via `GAP_FILL_ENABLED`**: The 6h symlink-verify task's `_attempt_arr_research` call (which triggers per-episode Sonarr/Radarr re-search when a broken symlink is deleted and the target content is truly gone from Zurg) previously required the opt-in `SYMLINK_REPAIR_AUTO_SEARCH=true` flag. It now also fires when `GAP_FILL_ENABLED=true` (default), because re-searching disappeared debrid content is part of the "available anywhere" reconcile story — if E04's file vanished from Zurg (RD cache eviction, WebDAV 404), gap-fill should close the hole the same way it closes a never-delivered one. Users who want auto-search off can set `GAP_FILL_ENABLED=false`; legacy `SYMLINK_REPAIR_AUTO_SEARCH=true` is still honored as an independent opt-in for the case where gap-fill is off but re-search on repair is still wanted. Test coverage updated in `tests/test_verify_symlinks.py`: `test_auto_search_disabled_by_default` is renamed to `test_auto_search_enabled_by_default_via_gap_fill` (asserts `_attempt_arr_research` IS called under defaults), and a new `test_auto_search_disabled_when_gap_fill_off_and_legacy_flag_off` locks down the both-off opt-out path.

## Version [2.20.0] - 2026-04-21

### Removed

- **Plan 35 Phase 6 — pd_zurg backward-compatibility surfaces fully removed**: Closes the rebrand arc that began with the 2.18.0 branding pass and the 2.19.0 dual-read / dual-emit deprecation window. Every `pd_zurg`/`PDZURG` identifier that 2.19.0 preserved behind a deprecation warning or a dual-emission helper is now gone — the legacy `PDZURG_LOG_*` env var names are no longer read (`base/__init__.py::_env_dual` and the three `os.environ.get('PDZURG_LOG_*', …)` fallbacks in `utils/logger.py::get_logger` are deleted; `utils/config_reload.py::SOFT_RELOAD` no longer lists `PDZURG_LOG_LEVEL`; `utils/config_validator.py` + `utils/settings_api.py` log-level validators no longer accept the legacy name; `utils/settings_api.py::read_env_values`'s `_LEGACY_ENV_ALIASES` fallback that surfaced a user's existing `PDZURG_LOG_*` value under the `ZURGARR_LOG_*` UI slot is deleted); the Prometheus metrics exporter no longer emits the `pd_zurg_*` prefix alongside `zurgarr_*` (`utils/metrics.py::_emit`'s two-prefix loop and the `(DEPRECATED — use zurgarr_X; removed in 2.20.0)` HELP-line suffix are gone, the `_LEGACY_PREFIX = 'pd_zurg'` constant is deleted, and the `# HELP zurgarr_X` lines are now clean — scrape payload halves back to the pre-2.19 size); the client-side `pd_zurg_theme` / `pd_zurg_log_wrap` localStorage migration is deleted (`utils/ui_common.py::LS_MIGRATION_JS`, `window._zurgarrLSGet/_zurgarrLSSet`, and the `'pd_zurg_' + key` concat path are gone — `THEME_INIT_SCRIPT`, `toggleTheme()`, `utils/system_page.py`'s `toggleLogWrap()` writer + init IIFE, and `utils/status_server.py`'s `_SETTINGS_SETUP_HTML` trailing script now read/write `zurgarr_theme` / `zurgarr_log_wrap` directly via plain `localStorage.setItem/getItem`); the `.pd_zurg_backup` atomic-swap sidecar forward-migration branch in `utils/library_prefs.py::replace_local_with_symlinks` (the `legacy_backup_path` + three-part `isfile + not islink + not lexists` guard + debug-logged OSError fallback, ~25 lines) is deleted — the function now reads and writes only `.zurgarr_backup`; and `utils/deprecation.py` is deleted entirely (the `warn_once` deduper, the `flush_pending` handler-attach flush, the `_LOGGER_NAME = 'PDZURG'` constant, the `_fired`/`_pending` module state — all gone with no remaining callers). One additional surface that Phase 5 explicitly deferred for log-stream continuity is **also** renamed this release rather than retained: `utils/logger.py::get_logger`'s default `log_name` parameter moves from `'PDZURG'` to `'ZURGARR'`, which changes the on-disk rotating-file name from `PDZURG-YYYY-MM-DD.log` to `ZURGARR-YYYY-MM-DD.log` and the `logging.getLogger()` channel name from `'PDZURG'` to `'ZURGARR'`. The default-parameter form of the call cascades cleanly — every one of the ~40 `get_logger()` call sites uses the default argument — so no call site needs editing. `utils/status_server.py::_CONFIG_PREFIXES` (the env-var filter list that drives the `/system` config viewer) drops `'PDZURG'` from its prefix set; the `'ZURG'` entry already covered `ZURGARR_LOG_*` by prefix match, so the new names stay visible in the viewer. User action required at 2.20.0 upgrade (enumerated here because 2.20.0 is a hard break for any user who didn't migrate during the 2.19.x soak — there is no longer a dual-read or dual-emit fallback to absorb the mismatch): rename any remaining `PDZURG_LOG_LEVEL` / `PDZURG_LOG_COUNT` / `PDZURG_LOG_SIZE` entries in `.env` to their `ZURGARR_LOG_*` counterparts (the in-UI save-the-form migration path that 2.19.x offered is no longer available once 2.20.0 is pulled — it was a 2.19.x-only knob-turn and the alias fallback it relied on is gone from `utils/settings_api.py::read_env_values` this release); rewrite every Grafana panel, Alertmanager rule, recording rule, and ad-hoc PromQL query that targets `pd_zurg_*` to use `zurgarr_*` (mechanical find-and-replace — sample values, label sets, and metric families are byte-identical between the two prefixes, so nothing downstream of the query needs to change); update any external log shipper, `tail -f` pipeline, log-rotation cron, or fluentd/Promtail scraper keyed on the `PDZURG-YYYY-MM-DD.log` filename pattern to `ZURGARR-YYYY-MM-DD.log` — internal `docker logs` output is unaffected because it reads stdout via the stream handler, not the rotating file; the WebUI `/system` log viewer is unaffected because it tails the current-day log by the live filename; only external tooling that hardcoded the legacy name needs updating. Stale `/log/PDZURG-*.log` files that existed on the host at upgrade are **not** rotated into or auto-cleaned by `ZURGARR_LOG_COUNT` on the new filename (backupCount is per-filename-pattern in Python's `TimedRotatingFileHandler`), so they persist on disk as orphaned artifacts — delete them manually if the disk footprint matters, or leave them in place as a before/after log-stream record of the upgrade. The WebUI `/system` log viewer's `read_log_lines()` glob pattern moves from `PDZURG-*.log` to `ZURGARR-*.log` in lockstep with the filename rename, so the viewer shows data as soon as the first ZURGARR-named log file is written (immediately on 2.20.0 start) — it will NOT surface legacy PDZURG-named files under any circumstance, so the upgrade's first-hour log history needs to be read via `docker exec zurgarr cat /log/PDZURG-<date>.log` or `docker logs zurgarr` if needed for forensics. No action is needed for localStorage (every browser that loaded a 2.19.x build migrated its `pd_zurg_theme` / `pd_zurg_log_wrap` entries on the first page load during the window — any browser that never loaded a 2.19.x build falls back to system-preference default on next visit, same failure mode as a fresh profile) or for on-disk `.pd_zurg_backup` sidecars (these existed only in the sub-second window between `os.rename` and `os.remove` inside `replace_local_with_symlinks` — anything stranded on disk today is the result of a host crash in that window; 2.19.0's forward-migration pass consumed any such file that had a prefer-debrid swap attempt on its specific path during the 2.19.x soak, and any residual files that persist past 2.20.0 are orphaned artifacts the user can `find /<local-library-root> -name '*.pd_zurg_backup' -delete` to clean). Test surface shrinks in parallel: `tests/test_deprecation.py` is deleted in full (10 tests covering `warn_once` dedupe, pre-handler buffering, and the `_env_dual` helper's four env-var combinations — all assertions were on removed code); `tests/test_library_prefs.py::TestReplaceLocalWithSymlinks` drops five migration-specific cases (stranded-legacy forward-migration, pre-existing-new-name clobber guard, directory-at-legacy-path guard, symlink-at-legacy-path guard, dangling-symlink-at-new-name-path guard) and keeps the two non-migration cases (clean-swap + rollback-restores-original-on-symlink-failure) with their assertions on `.pd_zurg_backup` removed; `tests/test_settings_api.py` drops four alias-fallback cases (`test_legacy_log_level_in_file_surfaces_under_new_key`, `test_legacy_log_level_in_env_surfaces_under_new_key`, `test_new_log_level_wins_over_legacy`, `test_save_under_new_name_drops_legacy_entry` — the save-migrates-legacy-out invariant they locked down is rendered moot by the alias fallback's removal); `tests/test_config_validator.py::test_bad_log_level_warns_legacy_pdzurg` is deleted and the new-name counterpart kept; `tests/test_config_reload.py` rewrites the three `PDZURG_LOG_LEVEL`-as-sample-soft-reload-var cases to use `ZURGARR_LOG_LEVEL` and collapses the `test_soft_reload_covers_new_zurgarr_log_names` dual-name test into the base `test_soft_reload_vars_defined`; `tests/test_metrics.py` drops the `TestDualEmission` class in full (8 tests on the two-prefix symmetry + DEPRECATED marker + clean-new-help invariants) and rewrites `TestFormatMetrics` + `TestEmitHelper` assertions from `pd_zurg_*` to `zurgarr_*`, plus adds two sweep tests (`test_no_legacy_prefix_anywhere` on `format_metrics` output, `test_no_legacy_prefix_emitted` on `_emit` output) so a future accidental revert of the dual-emission loop is caught by a failing assertion rather than silently slipping through; `tests/test_system_stats.py` rewrites 7 `pd_zurg_*` assertions on disk/fd/net metric names and their `# TYPE` annotations to `zurgarr_*`; `tests/test_status_ui_enhancements.py::TestLocalStorageMigration` is deleted in full (8 tests on the helper's presence, the copy-before-delete invariant, the fallback page's inline snippet, and the whole-surface sweep on `setItem('pd_zurg_*')`) and replaced with `TestLocalStorageKeys` — a smaller positive-only class that asserts `getItem('zurgarr_theme')` / `setItem('zurgarr_theme')` / `getItem('zurgarr_log_wrap')` / `setItem('zurgarr_log_wrap')` are present on every surface and `pd_zurg_` + `_zurgarrLS` never appear anywhere; `tests/conftest.py::clean_env` drops the three `PDZURG_LOG_*` names from its strip list (the new names were already there from Phase 1). To prevent a silent misread for users whose 2.20.0 container still has `PDZURG_*` env vars in their `.env` (the env var is no longer dual-read, so a `PDZURG_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` that went unrenamed would silently fall through to the `INFO` default without the user knowing their intent was ignored), `utils/config_validator.py::validate_config` now emits a one-shot startup warning listing every `PDZURG_*` env var it finds in `os.environ` with the message "Legacy env vars ignored since 2.20.0 (rename to ZURGARR_*): …". The warning lands on stdout (caught by `docker logs`) and in the rotating log file, so the signal reaches every deployment that spins 2.20.0 up with a dirty `.env`. The 2.19.0 soak window is the only migration contract — any deployment that skipped it (direct jump from pre-2.19 to 2.20.0, or from 2.19.x to 2.20.0 without ever setting the new env-var names) is on the user to reconcile before upgrade, but the startup warning ensures the user at least sees a clear diagnostic in the first few lines of the 2.20.0 container's log output. The `'PDZURG'` historical identifier now persists only in (1) the pre-2.19 CHANGELOG entries that document what shipped at the time (audit-trail integrity — do not rewrite), (2) the `LICENSE` + `README.md` "Migrating from pd_zurg" section that names the project users are migrating FROM, (3) the vendored `plex_debrid/` upstream code that is attribution-scoped by `plex_debrid/ATTRIBUTION.md`, and (4) whatever `/log/PDZURG-*.log` files persist on users' disks until they rotate off or the user deletes them — a permanent record of where the project came from and nothing more.

- **Internal comment / docstring sweep of stale `pd_zurg` references (plan 35 Phase 5)**: Final pass of plan 35 closes the 2.19.0 rebrand work by scrubbing the last internal prose that still said `pd_zurg` where it should have said `Zurgarr`. `git grep -n pd_zurg -- ':!CHANGELOG.md' ':!plex_debrid/'` surfaced five stale hits that missed the 2.18.0 branding sweep — four test docstrings (`tests/test_blackhole.py::test_read_tier_state_returns_none_for_legacy_file` describing the v1-sidecar backward-compat invariant as "a user upgrading pd_zurg mid-retry", `tests/test_status_ui_enhancements.py::test_excludes_unrelated_vars` summarising "Non-pd_zurg env vars should be excluded", `tests/test_symlink_switch.py::test_path_translation` calling the debrid mount "pd_zurg namespace", `tests/test_verify_symlinks.py::test_keeps_symlink_when_target_base_differs_from_mount` saying "Radarr/Sonarr's container but not in pd_zurg's") plus one stale test fixture value (`tests/test_config_validator.py::test_rclone_mount_name_valid` passing `RCLONE_MOUNT_NAME='pd_zurg-RD'` into the "valid mount name" assertion — updated to `zurgarr_mount-RD` rather than the intuitive `zurgarr-RD` so the fixture still exercises BOTH character classes allowed by the validator regex `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`; `zurgarr-RD` on its own would drop underscore coverage, leaving a silent gap if a future edit tightened the regex to `[a-zA-Z0-9-]+`). All five are non-behavioural: the docstrings describe invariants, and the fixture string is only validated for character-set acceptance so swapping the brand half leaves the underlying assertion intact. Every other `pd_zurg` hit the grep surfaced stays put by design and falls into one of four KEEP buckets documented by the plan: user-facing migration prose that needs to name the thing users are migrating FROM (README's "Migrating from pd_zurg" section, `.env.example` legacy-env-var note, `LICENSE` lineage attribution); Phase 1-4 shipping code that deliberately references the legacy name because it IS the backward-compat surface (`base/__init__.py::_env_dual` docstring, `utils/deprecation.py` module docstring, `utils/settings_api.py::read_env_values` docstring, `utils/metrics.py` dual-emitter, `utils/ui_common.py` localStorage helper, `utils/library_prefs.py` legacy-backup migration path); Phase 1-4 test suites that lock down the backward-compat behaviour and therefore assert against the legacy identifier directly (`tests/test_library_prefs.py` sidecar migration, `tests/test_metrics.py` + `tests/test_system_stats.py` dual-prefix emission invariants, `tests/test_status_ui_enhancements.py` localStorage-migration coverage); historical `CHANGELOG.md` entries under 2.18.x and earlier that correctly document what shipped under the pd_zurg name and must not be rewritten (audit-trail integrity per plan 35 §"Key Design Decisions"); and vendored `plex_debrid/` upstream code whose attribution the plan's `git grep` incantation explicitly excludes. The `utils/logger.py` internal logger name `'PDZURG'` (the default `log_name` parameter at `get_logger`) and the `PDZURG-YYYY-MM-DD.log` rotating-filename pattern it produces are also intentionally retained — renaming a live logger channel mid-deploy splits the log stream and invalidates on-disk log rotation state — and the rationale is captured inline at the `_LOGGER_NAME = 'PDZURG'` declaration in `utils/deprecation.py`. Unlike Phases 1-4 this surface has zero runtime impact so there's no deprecation helper, no new test, no soft-reload plumbing, and no version bump — it's a pure brand-consistency pass. At 2.20.0 the Phase 6 cleanup drops the backward-compat surfaces entirely (`_env_dual`, `warn_once`, dual metric emission, legacy localStorage helper, `.pd_zurg_backup` rename path), at which point the KEEP-list shrinks to just the historical CHANGELOG entries, the upstream-attribution prose, and the (optionally retained) `PDZURG` logger-channel identifier.

- **`.pd_zurg_backup` atomic-swap sidecar renamed to `.zurgarr_backup` with opportunistic migration of stranded legacy files (plan 35 Phase 4)**: The prefer-debrid preference path in `utils/library_prefs.py::replace_local_with_symlinks` performs an atomic three-step swap — rename the local file to a transient sidecar, create a symlink at the original path, delete the sidecar on success (or rename it back on symlink failure). The sidecar filename extension moves from the legacy `.pd_zurg_backup` to `.zurgarr_backup` in 2.19.0. The sidecar lives for milliseconds in the normal-completion path — rename → symlink → remove all happen inside a single function call — so it is almost never observable on disk; the only way a stranded legacy-named sidecar persists is if the container crashed (SIGKILL, host power-loss, kernel panic) in the tiny window between the `os.rename` and the subsequent `os.remove`. The plan's scanner-driven migration prose was overstated — no scanner walks the local library looking for stale backups, because the sidecar wasn't designed to persist. The real migration surface is inside `replace_local_with_symlinks` itself: before creating a fresh backup at a given path, the function now checks for a stranded `.pd_zurg_backup` at the SAME path and — only if no entry of any kind already occupies the `.zurgarr_backup` slot — renames the legacy-named sidecar forward to the new extension, so the rest of the swap logic (including the rollback rename on symlink failure) operates under the new name uniformly. The guard composes three distinct checks, each with a concrete failure mode it eliminates: `os.path.isfile(legacy_backup_path)` rejects a directory or FIFO that happens to share the legacy name (the pre-2.19 code path only ever created regular files, so anything else is hostile or spurious and renaming it forward would break the subsequent `os.rename(real_local, backup_path)`); `not os.path.islink(legacy_backup_path)` rejects a symlink at the legacy path (renaming a symlink would move the REFERENCE forward, then the atomic swap would replace the symlink itself with the user's local file and orphan whatever the symlink used to point at); `not os.path.lexists(backup_path)` rejects a pre-existing new-name entry of ANY kind — including a dangling symlink, which the naive `os.path.exists` check would report as missing and which would then be silently replaced by the rename. An `OSError` from the rename (EACCES on a read-only mount, EXDEV across filesystems, etc.) is swallowed at `DEBUG` level via `logger.debug` — the legacy file stays put, the next swap attempt on the same path retries the migration, and a persistent permission problem surfaces in the log rather than looping silently forever. No `warn_once` deprecation on this surface: the migration is file-system level, happens in a crash-recovery window the user can't meaningfully act on, and each stranded sidecar migrates exactly once when the user next triggers a prefer-debrid swap on that specific file. Seven new tests in `tests/test_library_prefs.py::TestReplaceLocalWithSymlinks` (the function had zero test coverage before Phase 4) lock down: the canonical clean-swap with the new extension (local file becomes a symlink to the translated `BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_TARGET_BASE`-rooted path, no sidecar under either extension remains); the stranded-legacy forward-migration (pre-seeded `.pd_zurg_backup` is gone after a successful swap — renamed forward to `.zurgarr_backup`, then consumed and deleted as the swap's own transient backup); the migration's guard against clobbering a pre-existing regular-file new-name backup; the failure-path rollback (a monkeypatched `os.symlink` that raises causes the original file to be restored with byte-identical contents, no sidecar remains under either extension, and the error message to the caller starts with `"Symlink failed (restored):"` so the UI can distinguish recovered-from failures from hard failures); and three hardened-guard cases — legacy sidecar that is a DIRECTORY (untouched, along with any squatter contents inside it), legacy sidecar that is a SYMLINK to a regular file elsewhere (untouched, symlink target unmodified), and a DANGLING new-name symlink (guard sees it via `lexists`, legacy file-name sidecar is preserved rather than silently replacing the dangling link). **At 2.20.0** the migration pass is removed and the function reads/writes only the new extension; any `.pd_zurg_backup` files that haven't been encountered by a swap on their specific path by then stay on disk as orphaned artifacts the user must clean up manually — negligible in practice because they exist at all only if a crash stranded them in the sub-second swap window.

- **localStorage keys `pd_zurg_theme` / `pd_zurg_log_wrap` migrated to `zurgarr_theme` / `zurgarr_log_wrap` with a one-shot per-browser migration (plan 35 Phase 3)**: The 2.18.0 rebrand deliberately preserved the two `pd_zurg_*` localStorage keys the WebUI uses to persist the theme-toggle state (Status / Library / Activity / Settings / System pages — light vs. dark) and the System-page log-viewer's line-wrap toggle, so no user had their saved preferences reset on upgrade. 2.19.0 renames both to the `zurgarr_*` prefix while keeping existing values intact via a tiny migration helper embedded in the page head. New `utils/ui_common.py::LS_MIGRATION_JS` defines `window._zurgarrLSGet(key)` and `window._zurgarrLSSet(key, val)` in the same `<script>` block as `THEME_INIT_SCRIPT` — that block runs as the first script in `<head>` to prevent FOUC on the theme, so attaching the helper to `window` there makes it reachable both from the FOUC-sensitive inline read AND from every later script that runs once the body loads (theme toggle in the sidebar, log-wrap toggle on the System page). The helper's read path checks the new key first, falls back to the legacy key, and on legacy-only hit copies the value to the new key and deletes the legacy entry in the same call — so after one page load per browser profile, subsequent reads follow the straight-line `getItem('zurgarr_<key>')` path and the legacy key no longer exists. Writes always target the new key only. `THEME_INIT_SCRIPT`, the `toggleTheme()` writer in `THEME_TOGGLE_JS`, and the System-page `toggleLogWrap()` writer + init IIFE all route through the helper; `document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', …)` and the `meta[name="color-scheme"]` sync logic in the head script are preserved unchanged so the FOUC-prevention contract is identical. The standalone "Settings Setup" fallback page (shown at `/settings` when `STATUS_UI_AUTH` is not configured) does not share the `get_base_head()` machinery — it's a self-contained HTML string — so it carries its own inline migration snippet with the same dual-read-then-copy-then-delete shape; that's one intentional duplication in Phase 3 and it's locked down by a dedicated test. Unlike Phases 1 (env vars) and 2 (Prometheus metrics) there is no server-side deprecation warning: the migration is strictly client-side and each browser profile migrates exactly once and is done, so per-process `warn_once` is the wrong tool for the surface. Idempotency property: running the helper on every page load is a no-op once the legacy key is gone, so the helper is safe to leave in place forever and trivial to remove in 2.20.0 (Phase 6) along with the other backward-compat surfaces. Seven new tests in `tests/test_status_ui_enhancements.py::TestLocalStorageMigration` lock down the helper's presence in the served head output, that no literal `pd_zurg_theme` or `pd_zurg_log_wrap` string survives in the theme or log-wrap paths (all access goes through the helper's `'pd_zurg_' + key` concatenation), that the FOUC-preventing head script reads via `_zurgarrLSGet('theme')` with `setAttribute('data-theme', …)` intact, that System-page log-wrap toggle/init both route through the helper, that the standalone settings-setup page carries its own inline migration with both key literals + `removeItem` + `setAttribute`, and a whole-surface sweep asserting no `setItem('pd_zurg_*')` write exists anywhere. **At 2.20.0** the helper and the inline migration snippet are removed and the theme/log-wrap scripts read/write `zurgarr_*` keys directly; users whose browser profile never visited a 2.19.x build lose their saved theme preference at that point and fall back to the system-preference default on next load (same failure mode as a fresh browser — acceptable for a homelab preference).

- **Prometheus metrics now dual-emit under `pd_zurg_*` and `zurgarr_*` prefixes (plan 35 Phase 2)**: Every metric exported from `/metrics` now ships under BOTH the legacy `pd_zurg_*` prefix AND the new `zurgarr_*` prefix so existing Grafana dashboards, alerting rules, and recording rules keyed on the historical names keep working while users migrate queries to the new prefix. Sample values and labels are byte-identical between the two prefixes — only the metric name changes. The legacy `# HELP pd_zurg_X` line carries a `(DEPRECATED — use zurgarr_X; removed in 2.20.0)` suffix so dashboards/viewers that surface HELP text in tooltips show the deprecation notice alongside the data; the new `# HELP zurgarr_X` line is clean. `utils/metrics.py` is refactored around a single `_emit(lines, name, help_text, metric_type, samples)` helper that every metric declaration routes through — both to eliminate the ~180 lines of per-metric HELP/TYPE boilerplate the previous implementation carried and to make "every new metric automatically dual-emits" a structural property of the codebase instead of a convention that must be remembered. The registry's counter-storage, label sanitization, and exposition-format glue are unchanged. Scrape payload roughly doubles during the deprecation window (~120 lines vs. ~60) which is negligible at homelab scale. HELP text itself was Zurgarr-rebranded ("Whether Zurgarr is running" replaces "Whether pd_zurg is running") — purely descriptive, affects no metric identity. Thirteen new tests in `tests/test_metrics.py` cover: both prefixes emit the same sample values and labels, TYPE annotations match, every legacy sample has a byte-identical new counterpart under the full metric surface (process/mount/service/system families included via a `patch.object(StatusData, 'to_dict')` fixture so the one-prefix regressions in gated families are caught), legacy HELP lines contain `DEPRECATED since 2.19.0` + the replacement name + the removal version, new HELP lines do not, and `_emit` materialises its `samples` iterable to a list on entry so generator-typed inputs don't exhaust after the first prefix emission. Pre-existing assertions in `tests/test_system_stats.py` that checked specific `pd_zurg_*` lines still pass because those lines are still emitted; the corresponding `zurgarr_*` assertions are added via `TestDualEmission` in `test_metrics.py`. **At 2.20.0** users must rewrite Grafana / Alertmanager / recording-rule queries from `{__name__=~"pd_zurg_.*"}` to `{__name__=~"zurgarr_.*"}` (or targeted equivalents) before upgrading; the prefix rename is a mechanical find-and-replace. `_emit`'s dual branch is removed in 2.20.0, dropping scrape payload back to ~60 lines.

- **`PDZURG_LOG_*` env vars renamed to `ZURGARR_LOG_*` with a two-release deprecation window (plan 35 Phase 1)**: The 2.18.0 rebrand scoped rename work to branding surfaces only, deliberately retaining `PDZURG_LOG_LEVEL` / `PDZURG_LOG_COUNT` / `PDZURG_LOG_SIZE` as-is so existing `.env` files kept working without user action. 2.19.0 opens the deprecation window: the new `ZURGARR_LOG_*` names are the preferred canonical form, and the legacy `PDZURG_LOG_*` names continue to work through 2.19.x but fire a one-shot deprecation warning at startup (dedupe keyed on `(surface, old_name)` via the new `utils/deprecation.py::warn_once` helper, so a warning shows up once per process lifetime even though `get_logger()` re-reads the env vars on every call). Both names are forwarded by `docker-compose.yml` through the container boundary; if a user sets BOTH, the new name wins with no warning (matches the common "I'm mid-migration and already using the new name" case). New `base.__init__._env_dual(new_name, old_name, default='')` helper applies the preference + warning policy uniformly; the three reads in `utils/logger.py` (`get_logger`) route through it. The deprecation warning's first fire happens inside `get_logger()` *before* the rotating-file handler is attached, so `warn_once` buffers pending payloads on a module-level list and `get_logger()` calls `flush_pending()` after `addHandler()` — this lands every deprecation line in the log file instead of silently dropping it to stderr via Python's `lastResort` handler. `utils/config_reload.py::SOFT_RELOAD` adds `ZURGARR_LOG_LEVEL` / `ZURGARR_LOG_COUNT` / `ZURGARR_LOG_SIZE` alongside the legacy `PDZURG_LOG_LEVEL` so SIGHUP still picks up log-level changes for users who've migrated to the new names. `utils/config_validator.py` and `utils/settings_api.py` log-level validators accept the new name too so a `ZURGARR_LOG_LEVEL=BOGUS` in `.env` produces the same warning path as `PDZURG_LOG_LEVEL=BOGUS`. `.env.example` now uses the new names in its commented examples with a one-line note pointing at the legacy-compat fallback; `docker-compose.yml` forwards both pairs explicitly so either works without template edits. The settings UI schema swaps the internal key to `ZURGARR_LOG_LEVEL` this phase (a deviation from the original plan text, which had deferred the schema swap to 2.20.0): keeping the legacy key as the schema identifier created a silent-shadowing UX trap where a user who pre-migrated their `.env` to the new name would see an empty "Zurgarr Log Level" field in the UI, save any value, and have it silently overridden at runtime by the unchanged new-name entry in `.env`. `read_env_values()` gains a `_LEGACY_ENV_ALIASES` fallback so the UI still surfaces the user's legacy value under the new-name slot when only the legacy name is set; saving the form then writes under the new name and cleanly drops the legacy `.env` line, migrating the user in one round-trip. `tests/conftest.py::clean_env` strips both legacy and new names so test isolation stays real. New `tests/test_deprecation.py` covers `warn_once` dedupe, message content, and the pre-handler-buffered / flush-pending emission path; `tests/test_settings_api.py` gains regression tests for the legacy→new alias fallback and the save-migrates-legacy-out invariant; existing `tests/test_config_validator.py` and `tests/test_config_reload.py` gain cases for the new names. **At 2.20.0** users must rename any remaining `PDZURG_LOG_*` entries in `.env` to `ZURGARR_LOG_*` before upgrading, or save once via the settings UI to let the alias fallback migrate the file automatically.

## Version [2.18.1] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **Zurgarr brand mark and favicon**: First proper visual identity for the project. New `assets/zurgarr.svg` (1024×1024 master) is a flat-shaded violet (`#7c3aed`) rounded square with a bold geometric white "Z" — same shape language as Sonarr/Lidarr/Prowlarr (rounded square, ~12.5% corner radius, single-colour glyph, no gradients) but in an unclaimed colour slot (Sonarr/Bazarr=blue, Radarr=yellow, Lidarr=green, Prowlarr=orange, Whisparr=pink, Tdarr=teal, Readarr=red — purple was open). The favicon is wired in via the existing `FAVICON_JS` machinery so it preserves the dynamic system-health colour swap that the lightning-bolt favicon used to do — the Z stays white, the rounded-square background fills with the brand violet at rest and shifts to amber on `warn` / red on `crit`. The sidebar header in every WebUI page now renders a 22×22 SVG of the same mark before the "Zurgarr" wordmark for at-a-glance brand recognition. New `assets/zurgarr-social.svg` (1280×640) is a matching social-preview card with the icon, wordmark, and tagline — drop into GitHub repo settings as the social preview after exporting to PNG. `assets/README.md` documents the design choices and the three regeneration paths (`rsvg-convert`, ImageMagick, Inkscape) for users who need PNG exports for Docker Hub or GitHub uploads. No raster assets are committed — modern browsers render the SVG favicon natively, and the only PNG-required destinations (Docker Hub logo, GitHub social preview) are upload-once manual steps where the user can convert the SVG once and forget about it.

## Version [2.18.0] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- **CI version-extraction step was reading from the wrong file**: `.github/workflows/docker-image.yml` shelled out to `grep -Po "(?<=version = ')[^']+" main.py` to derive the Docker image tag — but `version = '...'` was moved out of `main.py` into the dedicated `version.py` constant in commit `fc1a0cc` (Version [2.17.8]). The grep silently produced an empty string, which got written into `$GITHUB_ENV` as `VERSION=` and then interpolated into the Docker tags as `fjmerc/<repo>::latest` (note the doubled colon — the version-tag is empty between them). The image still got pushed under the `:latest` tag so the bug stayed invisible to anyone pulling latest, but the per-version tag (`fjmerc/<repo>:2.17.8`) was never published — meaning users who pinned to a specific version saw "manifest not found" for every release since 2.17.8 was cut. Fixed by reading from `version.py` instead: `VERSION=$(grep -Po "(?<=^VERSION = ')[^']+" version.py)`. The `^` anchor is intentional — it scopes the lookbehind to the canonical declaration line and won't accidentally match a `VERSION = '...'` literal inside a docstring or comment elsewhere in the file.

### Changed

- **Project renamed from pd_zurg to Zurgarr**: The fork has substantially diverged from the now-archived upstream [I-am-PUID-0/pd_zurg](https://github.com/I-am-PUID-0/pd_zurg) — 327+ commits ahead with new subsystems (library browser, debrid search, blackhole automation, history, blocklist, notifications, metrics, ffprobe monitor, MDBList integration), ~22k lines of tests, and full architecture documentation that don't exist upstream. The project is renamed to **Zurgarr** to fit the *arr ecosystem naming convention (Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr/Prowlarr) and signal that it is its own project rather than a thin downstream of pd_zurg. The MIT-licensed lineage is preserved with attribution in `README.md` ("Why This Project?" section), `LICENSE`, and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. Scope is **branding only** — internal Python module names, env var keys (`PDZURG_LOG_LEVEL`, `BLACKHOLE_*`, etc.), Prometheus metric names (`pd_zurg_*` prefix), localStorage keys, and the `.pd_zurg_backup` file extension are all deliberately retained for full backward compatibility. Existing `.env` files, Grafana dashboards, and on-disk state continue to work without migration.

- **User-facing rename surfaces**: Startup banner, status events, Apprise notification titles (`Zurgarr Started`, `Zurgarr Shutting Down`, `Zurgarr Daily Summary`), all WebUI page titles (`Zurgarr Status`, `Zurgarr Library`, `Zurgarr Activity`, `Zurgarr System`, `Zurgarr Settings`), the settings editor's "Zurgarr" tab label, the sidebar nav link, the workflow diagram node, the AllDebrid `agent` query parameter (`agent=zurgarr`), the User-Agent header sent to Torrentio/TMDB/Sonarr/Radarr (`zurgarr/1.0`), and the Basic Auth realm (`Basic realm="Zurgarr"` — browsers may prompt to re-save credentials once). Docker container name, image name, and service key in the example `docker-compose.yml` are now `zurgarr`. The default `RCLONE_MOUNT_NAME` in `.env.example` and `update_docker_compose.sh` is now `zurgarr` (was `pd_zurg`) — only affects fresh installs that rely on the default; existing deployments that set `RCLONE_MOUNT_NAME` explicitly are unchanged. README, ARCHITECTURE.md, and BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_GUIDE.md fully rebranded with a new "Migrating from pd_zurg" section. CI workflow auto-derives the published Docker image name from the GitHub repo name, so the image moves to `fjmerc/zurgarr` once the repository is renamed on GitHub; old `fjmerc/pd_zurg` images on Docker Hub remain pullable but are no longer pushed to.

- **Version bumped to 2.18.0** to mark the rename as a deliberate release boundary. The renamed Basic Auth realm is the only behavioural change requiring user action (re-saving browser credentials).

## Version [2.17.8] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- **Replaced unreadable startup ASCII-art banner with a clean separator header**: The Diamond-style figlet art at the top of `main()` was visually noisy and hard to parse — it spelled "PD ZURG" but the ornate font made the letters ambiguous, and as a Docker-only service whose startup is read in `docker logs` the decorative scroll-noise was net-negative. Replaced with a minimal three-line `===`-separator header (`pd_zurg v<version>` between two equals rules) that still gives a visible landmark in scrollback without pretending to be art. Also removed the now-redundant `ascii_art.format(version=version)` call — the f-string had already interpolated `{version}` so the `.format()` was a no-op preserved from a pre-f-string version of the banner.
- **WebUI version stuck at 2.11.0 while logs reported the real version**: `utils/status_server.py:421` carried its own hardcoded `self.version = '2.11.0'` literal that was never updated as releases shipped — independent from the `version` literal in `main()` that the 2.17.2 changelog claimed had been "fixed". The WebUI dashboard header (which reads `StatusData.version` via the `/api/status` payload) therefore lied about the running version for every release from 2.11.0 onward. Consolidated to a single source of truth: new top-level `version.py` exports `VERSION = '2.17.8'`; `main.py` and `utils/status_server.py` both `from version import VERSION`. The `StatusData.version` attribute, the startup ASCII banner, the `'main'` startup event, and the startup Apprise notification now all read from the same constant. CLAUDE.md updated to point at `version.py` so future bumps land in one place.
- **Library alphabetical jump bar now integrates with the viewport instead of floating over poster cards**: The right-side A-Z navigation in `utils/library_page.py` was styled as a floating "card" — fixed at `right:10px` with `var(--card)` background, 1px border, 10px border-radius, drop-shadow, and ~10px horizontal letter padding — so the bar visibly overlapped the rightmost movie poster (e.g. "1917" in screenshots) and read as a separate panel pasted on top of the grid. The desktop default reserved zero right-edge space on `.grid`, so cards extended to the viewport edge and got covered. Reworked to match the Sonarr/Radarr pattern: bar is now flush against the right edge (`right:0`), spans the full viewport height (`top:0;bottom:0`), is 22px wide with no background/border/border-radius/shadow, and renders letters as small (.72em) tightly-stacked text in the brand blue. The hover state still fills the letter chip with the accent colour but with a 3px radius rather than the prior 4px to read as a subtle highlight rather than a button. Added `padding-right:24px` to `.grid` at desktop and `22px` at the 641-900px tablet range so poster cards never slide under the fixed bar. Tablet (481-640px) horizontal sticky variant and mobile (≤480px) hidden variant are preserved with matching width/padding tweaks.
- **Housekeeping left stale `.torrent`/`.magnet` payloads in `/watch/failed/` forever**: The daily housekeeping task's "stale retry metadata" sweep (`utils/scheduled_tasks.py::housekeeping` section 3) filtered to `fname.endswith('.meta')` only, so `.magnet` and `.torrent` payload files in `failed/` had zero cleanup path — they accumulated indefinitely as Sonarr/Radarr racked up failed grabs over months or years. The sidecar-only rule made sense when both files aged together, but the retry loop keeps bumping the sidecar's mtime on every poll cycle even for items with `alt_exhausted=true`, so in practice the sidecar would eventually cross the 7-day threshold (with a fresh touch resetting that clock) while the payload's real age kept growing — leading to the observed pattern of `.magnet` files at 380-550h (16-23 days) sitting next to `.meta` sidecars at 143h (6 days, one day under the old cutoff). Section 3 now also sweeps `.magnet` and `.torrent` files in `failed/` (flat or label-scoped layouts) at the same 7-day threshold. `BlackholeWatcher._retry_failed` does poll `failed/` for retries, but with `MAX_RETRIES=3` and `RETRY_SCHEDULE=[5m, 15m, 1h]` the maximum live retry window is only ~80 minutes from when a file lands there — after that, the retry loop skips the file forever (`retries >= MAX_RETRIES` or `alt_exhausted=True`). A 7-day-old payload has therefore been terminal for 160× the max retry window — safely abandoned and eligible for cleanup. Non-payload file types in `failed/` are preserved intentionally so a misplaced file can be inspected and handled manually. Five regression tests cover the new behaviour: stale payload swept in flat and labeled layouts, fresh (<7d) payload preserved, payloads outside `failed/` (`/watch` root, `.alt_pending/`) preserved even when ancient, and unknown file types preserved. The pre-existing `test_leaves_torrent_files_alone` — which explicitly asserted the buggy behaviour — is replaced by the new `test_removes_stale_torrent_payload_in_failed`.
- **Quality-compromise tier order was inverted — compromise would descend UPWARD in quality on multi-tier profiles**: `SonarrClient.get_tier_order` / `RadarrClient.get_tier_order` preserved the order that the arr's `/api/v3/qualityprofile/{id}` endpoint returns its `items` array in, assuming (per the plan-33 design doc and the docstring example) that the API returned items preferred-first. In reality, Sonarr and Radarr return items in ASCENDING quality order (SDTV first, Remux-2160p last — the engine's internal quality-weight ordering that pre-dates any UI-level preference). The compromise engine's contract is `tier_order[0]` = user's preferred tier, `tier_order[-1]` = last-resort fallback, with `advance_tier` walking higher indices for progressively lower qualities. With the API order preserved, the engine treated 480p as the "preferred" tier for an "Any" profile (480p/720p/1080p allowed) and `should_compromise` → `'advance'` walked the index upward, which was upward in QUALITY rather than downward — the opposite of user intent. Strict profiles (1080p-only, 2160p-only) were unaffected because the engine short-circuits to `('exhausted', 'no_lower_tier_in_profile')` on single-tier lists before the ordering matters. Multi-tier profiles would have produced backwards compromise decisions the first time dwell elapsed on a seeded tier_state — but the bug was masked in tests because the hand-crafted `_PROFILE_WITH_GROUP` fixture and individual `get_tier_order` test fixtures were all written in descending order (matching the plan's wrong assumption), so the tests validated "preserve input order" rather than "match real-Sonarr input → produce preferred-first output". Fix: `get_tier_order` now calls `reverse()` on the collapsed-and-de-duplicated label list before returning. Existing consumers (`_try_compromise` reads `tier_order[current_idx]` for preferred and `tier_order[current_idx + 1]` for the next drop — both work correctly once the list is descending). Test fixtures in `tests/test_arr_client.py` (`_PROFILE_WITH_GROUP`, `test_get_tier_order_simple_profile`, `test_get_tier_order_falls_back_to_name_parse_when_resolution_missing`) are now in ASCENDING order to match real Sonarr output, so they validate the full pipeline rather than just order-preservation. A new `test_get_tier_order_real_sonarr_any_profile` regression test uses a frozen copy of the actual API response from a live Sonarr instance (the user's "Any" profile with SDTV/DVD/480p/720p/1080p allowed, `cutoff=Bluray-1080p`) to lock down the real-world behaviour against future drift. `RetryMeta.TIER_STATE_SCHEMA_VERSION` is bumped to `2` with a new `_MIN_TRUSTED_TIER_STATE_VERSION=2` floor: v1 sidecars (seeded under the inverted-order bug) are now rejected by `_validate_tier_state` and re-seeded fresh on the next retry pass, at the cost of resetting that item's dwell clock — acceptable because the alternative would be permanent backwards-compromise decisions for items seeded pre-fix. A dedicated regression test `test_read_tier_state_rejects_pre_fix_v1_schema` covers the invalidate-then-reseed path end-to-end. No manual migration required — the schema guard heals stale sidecars automatically.
- **Genre descriptor between title and year no longer mangles parsed titles**: Release folders that follow the `<Title> - <Genre> <Year> <Lang> <Quality> […]` convention (e.g. `Predestination - Sci-Fi 2014 Eng Rus Multi Subs 1080p [H264-mp4]` or `The Jacket - Phycological Thriller 2005 Eng Rus Ukr Multi Subs 1080p [H264-mp4]`) previously surfaced in the library grid as `Predestination Sci Fi (2014)` and `The Jacket Phycological Thriller (2005)` because the folder-name parser had no rule to strip the `- Genre` segment before the year. That polluted parsed title caused TMDB's year-filtered search to return zero results, so the canonical-title override from 2.17.8 never populated and the noisy folder text leaked into the UI. `_parse_folder_name` now strips ` - <GenreWord(s)>` when the word(s) after the literal space-dash-space match a closed allowlist (`Sci-Fi`, `Science Fiction`, `Psychological`/`Phycological Thriller`, and the 16 standard film genres) AND a plausible 4-digit year (`19xx`/`20xx`) follows. Legitimate subtitles (`Leon - The Professional 1994`, `Blade Runner - The Final Cut 2007`) stay untouched because their subtitle words aren't in the allowlist; quality markers like `1080p` cannot masquerade as years because the lookahead requires the century prefix. The stripped title now matches TMDB cleanly, the canonical override fires, and the library grid shows `Predestination (2014)` / `The Jacket (2005)` with proper posters and metadata.
- **Prefer-debrid force-grab no longer silently dropped by blackhole dedup for titles with punctuation**: When a user set `prefer-debrid` on a title whose canonical name contains a colon, apostrophe, or similar punctuation (e.g. `LEGO DC Batman: Family Matters`, `Ocean's Eleven`), Radarr/Sonarr would correctly force-grab a debrid release and hand the `.magnet` to pd_zurg's blackhole — which would then log `Skipping …magnet: '<title>' exists locally` and throw it away, because the dedup bypass for prefer-debrid looked up the preference under the release-filename-derived key (`lego dc batman family matters`) while preferences are stored under the canonical-title key (`lego dc batman: family matters`). Torrent filenames are dot-separated and never contained the punctuation to begin with, so the exact `prefs.get(name_norm)` lookup always missed and dedup ran. The force-grab would fire again on the next 6-hour retry and get dropped the same way indefinitely. The bypass now does a dual check — a strict `_normalize_title` comparison (lowercase + trailing-year strip, preserves punctuation and non-ASCII characters) AND a fuzzy `norm_for_matching` comparison (transliterates to ASCII, strips punctuation) — so the bypass fires for: canonical titles with punctuation matched against dot-separated release names, release filenames that retain `(YYYY)` parens that the year parser missed (`Name.(YYYY).quality.torrent`), and native-script CJK/Arabic/Cyrillic titles where transliteration collapses to empty. Also captures the matching pref key in the bypass log line so unexpected bypasses are diagnosable. Exposed `norm_for_matching` as a public alias in `library.py` for cross-module reuse. The broad `except` now logs a warning instead of silently swallowing failures, so a corrupt `library_prefs.json` surfaces rather than quietly disabling the bypass.

### Added

- **Project license + third-party attribution**: pd_zurg now ships an explicit `LICENSE` file at the repository root (MIT, `Copyright (c) 2026-present fjmerc and pd_zurg contributors`) covering the code authored for this project. The pre-existing `COPYING` file — which was actually rclone's MIT license inherited from upstream pd_zurg, not pd_zurg's own license — has been moved to `LICENSES/rclone.LICENSE` (history preserved via `git mv`) so the rclone attribution is unambiguous and no longer masquerades as the project license. New `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` at root inventories rclone (MIT, downloaded as a binary at image build time), Zurg (no upstream license declared, downloaded as a binary), and plex_debrid (no upstream license declared, vendored under `plex_debrid/`). New `plex_debrid/ATTRIBUTION.md` documents the vendoring relationship with itsToggle's upstream and notes that local modifications are visible via `git log -- plex_debrid/`. `README.md` gains a `Licensing` section that points at the new files; `ARCHITECTURE.md` corrects two stale "git submodule" references for `plex_debrid/` (the directory has been vendored — no `.gitmodules` exists). No code or runtime behaviour changes.

- **Smart quality compromise for the blackhole (plan 33 complete)**: pd_zurg's blackhole can now escalate to a lower quality tier when the user's preferred tier has no cached option on their debrid provider after a configurable waiting period — instead of moving the torrent to `failed/` and giving up. The arr's quality profile is always the ceiling: pd_zurg only drops within the allowed list, never invents a tier the profile doesn't permit. Typical flow: set `QUALITY_COMPROMISE_ENABLED=true`, Sonarr/Radarr drop a torrent at 2160p, debrid rejects it, pd_zurg retries the arr's alternative list at 2160p and stores a per-file sidecar recording the first preferred-tier attempt; after `QUALITY_COMPROMISE_DWELL_DAYS` (default 3) of unsuccessful retries the engine probes one tier down (e.g. 1080p) via Torrentio, checks the debrid cache for each candidate, grabs the best cached release at the lower tier, and lets Sonarr/Radarr's normal upgrade logic reclaim the preferred tier later when a cached 2160p finally appears — so compromises are never permanent. Every compromise fires a `compromise_grabbed` history event, annotates `pending_monitors.json` with `{preferred_tier, grabbed_tier, reason, strategy}`, renders a `↓ <tier>` badge on the library detail page, and is surfaced via `GET /api/blackhole/compromises` (latest 50) — even when `QUALITY_COMPROMISE_NOTIFY=false` silences Apprise, so users can't lose the audit trail. Opt-in season-pack fallback (`SEASON_PACK_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true`) probes a cached pack at the PREFERRED tier before any tier drop for shows with `>= SEASON_PACK_FALLBACK_MIN_MISSING` holes and a missing-episode ratio `>= SEASON_PACK_FALLBACK_MIN_RATIO` (0.4), so a show with 5/10 holes gets the pack rather than an episode-at-1080p compromise. The feature is strictly additive and OFF by default; users roll back with `QUALITY_COMPROMISE_ENABLED=false` and legacy `RetryMeta` sidecars without `tier_state` continue to work (no data migration). Real-Debrid note: RD deprecated their instant-availability endpoint in Nov 2024, so RD users under the default `QUALITY_COMPROMISE_ONLY_CACHED=true` will never compromise — flip `ONLY_CACHED=false` for aggressive escalation or switch to AllDebrid/TorBox for cache-aware behaviour. See the per-phase entries below for the foundation (profile reader → RetryMeta v2 → debrid cache probe → decision engine → blackhole wiring → observability → config surface) and `BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_GUIDE.md` for the user-facing setup.
- **Quality-compromise config surface (plan 33 Phase 7)**: Three new env vars finish the smart-compromise feature's user-facing controls: `QUALITY_COMPROMISE_MAX_TIER_DROP` (default `2`, range `1-10`) caps how far below the preferred tier the engine may descend — `current_tier_index >= max_tier_drop` now short-circuits `should_compromise` to `('exhausted', 'max_tier_drop_reached')` before the dwell gate so an exhausted allowance fails fast instead of burning another 3-day wait. The env-var surface enforces `minimum=1`; users who want effectively-unlimited drops set a large value (e.g. 10) and the arr's profile ceiling still short-circuits via `no_lower_tier_in_profile`. `0` is deliberately rejected at both the validator and the runtime clamp because "zero drops allowed" is an intuitive read that the pure-function contract treats as the dangerous opposite — the code defends that internal sentinel for caller-bug defence-in-depth but users can no longer hit it. `SEASON_PACK_FALLBACK_MIN_RATIO` (default `0.4`) adds an AND-ed ratio gate to `find_season_pack_candidate` — the missing share of the season must be at least this fraction before a pack probe fires, preventing a 40-episode season with 4 holes (10%) from triggering a whole-season grab when only a few episodes are legitimately missing. `0.0` disables the ratio gate (pure `MIN_MISSING` behaviour — back-compat). `QUALITY_COMPROMISE_NOTIFY` (default `true`) is an Apprise-only opt-out: setting it `false` silences the `compromise_grabbed` notification but leaves the `history.log_event('compromise_grabbed', ...)` call and the `pending_monitors.json` annotation untouched (invariant I7 — the dashboard compromise trail is non-negotiable). All nine compromise env vars (the six from Phase 5 plus the three new ones) are now documented in `.env.example` with risk/mitigation framing, exposed in a new `Quality Compromise` section in the settings UI (Settings → Quality Compromise — the master toggle sits at the top with a description that spells out that all fields below are inert while it's OFF), and added to `utils/config_reload.py::SOFT_RELOAD` so SIGHUP picks up toggle changes without restarting any service (the values are read fresh from `os.environ` on every blackhole retry, so no module globals need rebinding). New integer ranges (`DWELL_DAYS 1-30`, `MIN_SEEDERS 0-1000`, `MAX_TIER_DROP 1-10`, `MIN_MISSING 1-100`) wire into `validate_env_values`'s numeric-range checker; the ratio is validated separately as a `[0.0, 1.0]` float because the `number:MIN-MAX` renderer coerces to int (and would round `0.4` down to `0` silently).  Both the `_float_env` clamp and the ratio validator explicitly reject NaN and infinity — NaN compares False to every bound, so without the guard a misconfigured `MIN_RATIO=nan` would silently bypass the ratio gate at runtime AND pass UI validation without a warning. `QUALITY_COMPROMISE_ONLY_CACHED` and `QUALITY_COMPROMISE_NOTIFY` join `BLOCKLIST_AUTO_ADD` / `ROUTING_AUTO_TAG_UNTAGGED` in `_ENV_DEFAULTS` so the true-default toggles render as ON out of the box in the Settings UI instead of misleading the user. New `BlackholeWatcher._float_env` helper mirrors `_int_env` with min/max clamping so a misconfigured ratio (`1.5` or `-0.1`) gets pinned to the safe range instead of disabling or over-triggering the gate. No per-section grey-out for dependent controls when the master toggle is OFF — no existing settings-UI precedent for gated sections and the scoped work is already wide enough; the section description spells out the dependency in plain English. Seventeen new tests in `tests/test_config_compromise_env.py` cover MAX_TIER_DROP capping escalation (including the profile-ceiling ordering and the first-drop/second-drop boundary), MIN_RATIO gating small seasons without hitting Torrentio, NOTIFY=false skipping Apprise while history + pending_monitors still fire, SIGHUP-style soft-reload picking up toggle changes, validator rejection of out-of-range / NaN / inf ratio, and the runtime clamp that defends against `MAX_TIER_DROP=0` leaking in from pre-Phase-7 configs.
- **Quality-compromise observability (plan 33 Phase 6)**: Quality-compromise grabs are now surfaced directly in the dashboard and library detail views so the "why did pd_zurg grab 1080p when 2160p was in the profile?" answer is one click away instead of buried in the log. New `GET /api/blackhole/compromises` endpoint returns the last 50 `compromise_grabbed` history events in a structured shape — `title`, `media_title`, `episode`, `preferred_tier`, `grabbed_tier`, `reason`, `strategy` (`tier_drop` or `season_pack`), `compromised_at` (ISO8601), `dwell_days`, and the cached/uncached candidate counts observed at the preferred tier. To make the structured fields reachable without parsing the human-readable detail body, `_try_compromise` now enriches `compromise_meta` with `dwell_seconds` plus the per-tier `cached_hits_found`/`uncached_hits_found` it already has in-memory from the `tier_state` attempt log, and `_submit_compromise_candidate` passes the meta dict through to `history.log_event(... meta=...)` — `_add_pending` still cherry-picks its own keys so the extra fields never pollute `pending_monitors.json`. The library detail view (both movie and show — invariant I5 parity) now renders a `↓ <tier>` pill next to the existing quality badge for titles with a recent `compromise_grabbed` history event; the badge tooltip reads "Compromised from `<preferred>` — reason=`<reason>`". The badge re-uses the already-loaded `/api/history/show/<title>?limit=30` payload (no extra fetch) and scans it for the most recent compromise event on the detail title. `compromise_grabbed` also gains proper sidebar styling (acquisition category, ↓ icon, "Quality Compromise" label) so the timeline event renders as a first-class activity item rather than a raw underscore-separated string.
- **Blackhole quality-compromise wiring (plan 33 Phase 5)**: The blackhole alt-retry pipeline now consumes the Phase 4 decision engine. When an arr (`Sonarr`/`Radarr`) drops a torrent that the debrid service rejects and the arr's alternative list at the preferred tier is exhausted (or empty), pd_zurg seeds per-file tier state from the arr's quality profile (`get_profile_id_for_series`/`get_profile_id_for_movie` + `get_tier_order`) on the FIRST alt-retry and keeps that baseline pinned on subsequent retries via `RetryMeta.init_tier_state`'s idempotent contract — so the I3 dwell clock measures from the first preferred-tier attempt, not the most recent one. After `_try_releases` returns False, `_try_compromise` calls the Phase 4 `should_compromise` gate with `QUALITY_COMPROMISE_DWELL_DAYS` (default 3) and, on `'advance'`, probes `find_compromise_candidate` at the next permitted tier via Torrentio + cache annotation. A successful grab writes the magnet via the existing debrid handler, removes the original, advances `RetryMeta.tier_state` BEFORE starting the symlink monitor (crash-safety: a mid-flight failure can't leave the item stuck at the old tier), starts the monitor with a new `compromise={preferred_tier, grabbed_tier, reason, strategy}` annotation that propagates to `pending_monitors.json`, emits a `compromise_grabbed` notification (new event in `ALL_EVENTS`, documented in the `NOTIFICATION_EVENTS` settings help), and logs a `compromise_grabbed` history event. When `SEASON_PACK_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true` and the series has `>= SEASON_PACK_FALLBACK_MIN_MISSING` episodes with `hasFile=False` in the target season, a cached pack at the PREFERRED tier is probed BEFORE any tier drop — a same-tier pack grab never advances `current_tier_index` because normal episode grabs going forward should still attempt the preferred tier; `RetryMeta.mark_season_pack_attempted` fires whether the probe finds a pack or not so retries don't re-query Torrentio every cycle. Nine new env vars (read at `Config.load()` time; Phase 7 will add them to the settings UI and soft-reload set): `QUALITY_COMPROMISE_ENABLED` (master toggle, default `false` — feature is strictly additive when off), `QUALITY_COMPROMISE_DWELL_DAYS` (3), `QUALITY_COMPROMISE_MIN_SEEDERS` (3), `QUALITY_COMPROMISE_ONLY_CACHED` (true — I4: cached=None treated as not cached under strict mode, so Real-Debrid users whose `instantAvailability` endpoint was deprecated Nov 2024 never end up with an uncached compromise), `SEASON_PACK_FALLBACK_ENABLED` (false), `SEASON_PACK_FALLBACK_MIN_MISSING` (4). `_submit_compromise_candidate` is factored separately from the magnet-submit inner loop in `_try_releases` because the compromise path needs distinct pending/history/notification lineage and tier-state mutation on success. Tier advancement is persisted BEFORE the monitor thread starts so a crash in between cannot leave an item stranded at the old tier. Eight wiring tests in `tests/test_compromise_wiring.py` cover the disabled-passthrough, dwell gate, profile ceiling, only-cached I4 gate, authorized tier-drop, pending-monitor annotation, season-pack-before-tier-drop strategy, and Radarr movie parity. Nothing changes for users who don't set `QUALITY_COMPROMISE_ENABLED=true` — all existing retry/failure semantics are preserved; the feature is pure addition behind the master toggle.
- **Quality-compromise decision engine (plan 33 Phase 4)**: New `utils/quality_compromise.py` houses the pure `should_compromise(tier_state, now, dwell_seconds, only_cached)` decision function plus `find_compromise_candidate` and `find_season_pack_candidate` helpers that Phase 5 will wire into the blackhole retry loop. `should_compromise` is I/O-free — it reads the v2 `tier_state` dict produced by `RetryMeta.read_tier_state` and returns `('stay', ...)` / `('advance', ...)` / `('exhausted', ...)` based on dwell elapsed (invariant I3) and whether any lower tier remains in the profile. Legacy sidecars without `tier_state` surface as `('stay', 'legacy_no_tier_state')` so the pipeline never crashes on pre-v2 files. `find_compromise_candidate` wraps `search_torrents(annotate_cache=True, sort_mode='cached_first')` and enforces the full filter chain: tier-label double-check (invariant I1 — a 2160p release can't leak through when the caller asked for 1080p), hash blocklist reject, `seeds >= min_seeders` floor, and `cached is True` when `only_cached` is set (invariant I4 — `cached=None` is treated as not cached, so RD users under strict mode never compromise to a possibly-uncached release). Within-tier ranking falls back to `(seeds desc, size_bytes asc)` because Torrentio results don't carry Sonarr/Radarr's `customFormatScore` — the rationale is documented inline so future readers understand why `_force_grab_sort_key` semantics aren't reachable here. `find_season_pack_candidate` is TV-only: preflights via `arr_client.get_episodes` so a season with fewer than `min_missing` holes never triggers a probe, then probes Torrentio series-scoped and classifies packs via the existing `_is_multi_season_pack` detector (multi-season range covers the target) OR a single-season token (`S{NN}` without an `SxxEyy` episode token). `_is_multi_season_pack` is lazy-imported to sidestep the Phase-5 circular-import scenario where `utils/blackhole.py` will pull this module in. 13 unit tests in `tests/test_quality_compromise.py` cover each invariant and the 13 scenarios in the plan. No behaviour change: nothing consumes these helpers yet; Phase 5 is the integration point.
- **Debrid cache probe + cache-aware search sort (plan 33 Phase 3)**: New `check_debrid_cache(info_hashes)` helper in `utils/search.py` batches cache-availability lookups against the auto-detected debrid provider and returns a `{hash: True|False|None}` map (`None` = unknown: timeout, API failure, no service, or provider has no pre-add cache endpoint). AllDebrid (`/v4/magnet/instant`) batches the whole request in one POST and matches results by the hash the API echoes back — not by list index — so a dropped or reordered entry cannot mis-tag another hash. Defensive `_coerce_instant` accepts bool OR `"true"`/`"false"` strings in case AD ever serialises differently. TorBox (`/api/torrents/checkcached`) probes per-hash with a hard cap of 25 hashes per call (guards against unbounded fan-out: 50+ Torrentio results × 10 s timeout would otherwise stall the status-server worker for minutes); overflow hashes stay as `None`. Non-dict TB payloads are treated as unknown rather than false per the plan's I4 contract. Real-Debrid's `/torrents/instantAvailability` was deprecated by RD in Nov 2024; the stub returns `None` uniformly without hitting the network and emits a single process-lifetime warning so users with RD + `QUALITY_COMPROMISE_ONLY_CACHED=true` understand why compromise never fires. All probe URLs — including AD's query string with `apikey=…` and TB's `Authorization` header — are routed through `_safe_log_url` so credentials never leak into warning logs. `_urllib_post` gained an opt-in `doseq=True` parameter so repeated form fields like `magnets[]` encode correctly, replacing a duplicated manual `urllib.request.Request` construction. `search_torrents()` gains two opt-in kwargs: `annotate_cache=False` (when True, every result carries `cached` + `cached_service` fields) and `sort_mode='quality'`/`'cached_first'` (cached_first sorts `(cached desc, quality desc, seeders desc)` so a cached 1080p outranks an uncached 2160p, with `None` normalised to "not cached" for sort comparability). The annotation path resolves the debrid service exactly once and passes it through to `check_debrid_cache` so `cached_service` is provably identical to the service that produced the map. Defaults preserve today's manual-search UI behaviour unchanged — the manual UI continues to sort by quality until the UI opt-in toggle lands.
- **RetryMeta v2 tier-state schema for smart-compromise escalation (plan 33 Phase 2)**: The blackhole retry sidecar (`<file>.meta`) now carries an optional nested `tier_state` object tracking the quality-compromise state machine — `schema_version`, `arr_service`, `arr_url_hash` (SHA-256 of the arr base URL truncated to 6 hex chars, so a `sonarr-4k` + `sonarr-hd` setup gets independent per-instance state without logging raw URLs), `profile_id`, `tier_order` (snapshot of allowed resolutions at seed time), `current_tier_index`, `first_attempted_at` (dwell baseline), `tier_attempts` (per-tier history with attempt counts and cached/uncached hit counts), `compromise_fired_at`, `last_advance_reason`, and `season_pack_attempted`. New static helpers on `RetryMeta` — `init_tier_state` (idempotent: never resets `first_attempted_at`, so retries can't game the I3 dwell timer), `read_tier_state` (returns `None` for legacy v1 sidecars — backward compatibility hinge — and for malformed or future-schema tier_state so the decision loop degrades gracefully), `record_tier_attempt` (upserts per-tier entry; refuses bool/negative indices and out-of-range indices per I1), `advance_tier` (I2 monotonic downward — refuses decrement, refuses stay, refuses out-of-range; sets `compromise_fired_at` only on first advance), `mark_season_pack_attempted`. Also centralises alt-exhaustion flag writes: `mark_alt_exhausted` / `is_alt_exhausted` replace two raw `open()` + `json.dump` call sites in `_try_alternative_release` and `_recover_stranded_alt_pending` that would clobber the whole sidecar — they now preserve `tier_state` so alt-exhaustion no longer silently resets the dwell clock. All writes route through `utils.file_utils.atomic_write` (torn-write safety) and `_save_raw` catches `TypeError`/`ValueError` alongside I/O errors so a non-serializable value can't kill the watcher poll cycle. A module-level `threading.RLock` serializes load-modify-save so concurrent callers (blackhole worker + alt-retry thread) can't interleave reads and writes in a way that drops a tier advance. `RetryMeta.write()` now preserves unrelated keys (`alt_exhausted`, `tier_state`, etc.) so a retry-count bump no longer wipes compromise state, and surfaces a warning if persistence fails instead of silently retrying forever. No behaviour change: nothing consumes the tier-state helpers yet; Phase 5 wires them into `_try_alternative_release`.
- **Quality-profile reader foundation for smart-compromise escalation (plan 33 Phase 1)**: `SonarrClient` and `RadarrClient` now expose `get_quality_profile(profile_id)` (wraps `GET /api/v3/qualityprofile/{id}`) and `get_tier_order(profile_id)` (returns the profile's allowed qualities as an ordered resolution-label list such as `['2160p', '1080p', '720p']`, collapsing within-resolution sources like Bluray/WEB-DL/HDTV into a single tier and respecting the profile UI's group-disabled semantics). Convenience accessors `get_profile_id_for_series(series_id)` / `get_profile_id_for_movie(movie_id)` read the profile ID off the series/movie record. Implementation lives in the shared `_ArrClientBase` so both arrs inherit identical logic (plan invariant I5 — parity). Profiles are cached per-client for 15 minutes (failed fetches are NOT cached so a transient 5xx doesn't lock the profile out for the full TTL); the cache is keyed by profile ID and per-client so a Sonarr-4K + Sonarr-HD setup stays isolated. Unrecognised quality entries (no resolution field, unparseable name) are dropped rather than guessed — honours plan invariant I1 (the profile is the ceiling, never invent a tier). This is read-only foundation with no behaviour change; subsequent phases will consume it to probe debrid cache availability and escalate blackhole items to the next permitted tier after a user-configurable dwell window.
- **Auto-tag untagged series/movies during routing audit**: The 6-hour `audit_download_routing` task now sweeps Sonarr series and Radarr movies for entries that have no routing tag (none of `debrid`/`local`/`usenet`) and applies the `debrid` tag + triggers a search. Self-heals the silent-failure mode where Overseerr sends new requests to Sonarr/Radarr with `tags=[]` (the Tags field on Overseerr's Sonarr/Radarr server config was never populated) — torrent indexers filter by routing tag so untagged series see "0 active indexers" and the post-add search returns no results, leaving requests to rot indefinitely until a human notices. Only touches monitored titles whose tag list contains none of the three routing tags (user-chosen local-only or usenet-only routing is preserved, as are any custom user tags). Capped at 25 tags per cycle to bound search pressure; larger backlogs drain across subsequent audits. Opt out via the new `ROUTING_AUTO_TAG_UNTAGGED` toggle (Settings → Media Services, default: on) or `ROUTING_AUTO_TAG_UNTAGGED=false` in `.env`. Emits a `routing_repaired` history event per audit that applies tags.
- **Library search field now has a clear (×) button**: The search field on the library page previously relied on the browser's native `type="search"` clear control, which renders inconsistently — WebKit/Chromium shows it only while focused, Firefox doesn't show one at all. Added an always-visible circular × button that appears inside the field whenever it contains text, positioned on the right with the existing magnifier icon on the left. Click clears the input, re-applies filters, and refocuses the field; the existing Escape shortcut keeps the button state in sync. Hides the native webkit cancel button so the two don't double up.
- **Sticky library toolbar**: The Movies/Shows tabs and the search/filter/sort controls now stay pinned to the top of the viewport while scrolling the library grid, matching the Plex nav behavior. The search field, source/year/status filters, sort selector, and Select/Refresh buttons remain accessible without scrolling back up on long libraries. Alphabetical jump-bar letter clicks measure the live toolbar height at click time and apply it as `scroll-margin-top` on the target card so the poster lands fully below the toolbar regardless of how many rows the controls wrap to on narrow viewports. The wrapper is hidden entering/leaving the detail view (so the shadow doesn't paint as a phantom stripe), disabled on the tablet 481-640px range where the horizontal jump-bar takes the top sticky slot instead, and its negative-margin edge extension tracks the main-content padding breakpoint (20px desktop, 16px ≤768px) so the background never overshoots the content column.
- **Plex-style library detail page**: Library detail views now surface a compact `year · runtime · rating` meta row, a genres line, director (movie) or creator (show) byline, and a horizontal `Cast & Crew` photo strip of up to 15 top-billed actors. The TMDB score badge sits centered below the poster. The cast scroller has `‹` / `›` arrow buttons on desktop that scroll the strip by ~70% of its width; arrows auto-disable at the start/end and hide on mobile (touch-swipe instead). The Activity panel moved from a right-hand sidebar to a full-width section below the seasons/cast, so it no longer floats awkwardly next to short content or wastes column space next to long shows. Powered by the existing TMDB cache — existing cache entries refresh transparently over 7 days as users browse, bulk lookups keep using legacy entries until the refetch lands (no regression during the migration window). Set `TMDB_RATING_COUNTRY` (default `US`) to pick MPAA/content ratings from a non-US country.

### Fixed

- **Boolean toggles in Settings UI now render correctly for true-default env vars**: Fields like `BLOCKLIST_AUTO_ADD` and `ROUTING_AUTO_TAG_UNTAGGED` default to ON at runtime (their Config defaults are `'true'`), but the Settings UI was reading them via `read_env_values()` which returned empty string when the var wasn't explicitly set in `.env` or `os.environ`. The JS renderer treated empty as false and displayed the toggle as OFF, making the UI lie about what the app was actually doing. `read_env_values()` and `get_env_defaults()` now fall back to an `_ENV_DEFAULTS` map for vars whose application default is non-empty, so true-default toggles render as ON out of the box and "Reset to defaults" restores the real default instead of an empty string. Explicit user values (including an explicit `false`) still take precedence.
- **Library titles use canonical TMDB name instead of messy folder text**: Multi-language torrent folders that bundle two titles in the release name (e.g. `Crime.101.-.La strada.del.crimine.2026...` or `Jurado Nº 2 (Juror #2) (2024)...`) previously surfaced in the library grid with the full bundled string ("Crime 101 La strada del crimine", "Jurado Nº 2 (Juror #2)") because the parsed folder name was used as the display title even when TMDB enrichment had already correctly identified the movie/show. The library scanner now replaces `item['title']` with the canonical TMDB title when a TMDB cache hit is available, applies symmetrically to movies and shows, and registers the (parsed → canonical) normalized-title pair in the scanner's alias map so existing preferences and pending entries saved under the old name continue to resolve.
- **Activity page pagination no longer overflows for large histories**: The Activity page emitted one link per page in a flat horizontal strip, so a history with 79 pages rendered 79 page numbers in one line that overflowed the viewport. The pager now windows to `{first, current±2, last}` with `…` ellipsis gaps and dedicated `‹`/`›` prev/next links — e.g. `‹ 1 … 25 26 [27] 28 29 … 79 ›` — so it stays compact regardless of history size while keeping single-click access to the ends.
- **Prefer-debrid force-grab now respects arr profile rules**: The interactive-search push used by `prefer_debrid=True` (`_grab_debrid_release` in Sonarr and Radarr) took `torrents[0]` from Radarr/Sonarr's release list with no filtering — a Jackett-backed public-tracker search would frequently put a 2160p Remux or BR-DISK first by seeder count, and pd_zurg would grab that 40-60+ GB file even when the user's profile only allowed 1080p WEBDL. The force-grab now excludes any release Radarr/Sonarr rejected for a profile violation (quality tier not allowed, custom-format score below minimum, size floor, parse failure, etc.) while explicitly allowing releases rejected only because the existing file already meets the cutoff — the feature's intended bypass. Remaining candidates are sorted by `(customFormatScore desc, seeders desc)` so the user's profile scoring decides the winner, with missing/unknown scores sorted to the bottom so they cannot outrank legitimately negative scores. Logs the chosen release's score, seeders, and size for post-mortem visibility. Sonarr dedup now also checks `infoHash` to prevent pushing the same season pack twice under different GUIDs.
- **`/api/restart/test` 400 no longer shows in the browser console**: The frontend auth probe POSTed to `/api/restart/test` on every page load and relied on the 400 "unknown service" response to detect that the user was authenticated. The 400 surfaced as a red error in DevTools on every page load, noisy during screen shares and when debugging unrelated issues. Replaced the probe with a dedicated `GET /api/auth/check` endpoint that returns 200/403 cleanly — 200 when auth is not configured or valid credentials are provided, 403 when auth is configured but not provided.
- **Library detail view no longer flickers during background polls**: The detail page re-rendered its entire content area on every smart-poll tick (every 15 s when any library item had pending state), nuking the poster, cast strip, seasons, and Activity sidebar even when the payload was byte-identical to the last render. Each re-render also refetched `/api/history/show/…`. Added a signature-based guard (`_lastDetailSig`) that skips `_renderDetail()` when the detail item, its pending state, and its preference are unchanged; re-renders still fire when data actually changes (action completes, pending clears, etc.).

### Fixed

- **Library back button restores scroll position**: Clicking "← Back to Library" from a movie or show detail view previously scrolled all the way back to the top of the A's, forcing the user to re-scroll to find where they were. The library page now captures `window.scrollY` when opening the detail view and restores it after the grid re-renders on back, so the user lands exactly where they clicked. Also adds `preventScroll:true` to the search-input refocus call so the input no longer pulls the viewport when the detail view closes.
- **Blocklist no longer blocks replacement releases**: Blocklisting a specific release (e.g. a buffering 2160p) previously blocked ALL versions of the same title, preventing the library scanner from creating symlinks for a replacement release (e.g. a 1080p). The blocklist check in debrid symlink creation now matches on the full release folder name instead of the parsed title, so different quality releases of the same movie or show are handled independently.
- **Broken debrid symlinks are now auto-cleaned**: When a debrid torrent is removed or replaced, symlinks in the local library pointing to the old content became permanently broken — causing Zurg 404 errors and leaving arrs in a `hasFile: false` state. The library scanner now detects and removes broken debrid symlinks before creating new ones, allowing replacement content to be linked automatically in the same scan cycle.
- **Symlink verify no longer refuses to clean large backlogs**: The scheduled `verify_symlinks` task had a safety threshold that refused to delete broken symlinks when >50 were found and >50% appeared broken. This created a self-reinforcing cycle where broken symlinks accumulated past the threshold and could never be cleaned. Replaced the threshold with a proper mount health guard (non-empty mount listing), which is the correct protection against mass deletion during mount failures.

## Version [2.17.7] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- **Blackhole per-arr label routing**: pd_zurg can now route completed symlinks into per-arr subdirectories, preventing Sonarr from logging orphan "Directory not empty" warnings for Radarr-submitted movies (and vice versa). Drop a `.torrent` into `BLACKHOLE_DIR/sonarr/` and the symlink lands in `BLACKHOLE_COMPLETED_DIR/sonarr/`; Radarr works the same way under `radarr/`. Opt-in via directory layout — no new env var, and flat layout remains fully supported. Also supports custom labels (e.g. `sonarr-4k`, `sonarr-hd`, `readarr`) for multi-instance setups. See `BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_GUIDE.md` for the labeled-layout setup and migration steps.
- **Rclone dir cache flush on demand**: Rclone's RC API is now enabled automatically. The blackhole flushes the dir cache before waiting for new files on the mount, and the library scanner flushes before FUSE fallback scans. This eliminates the 30-minute wait for `RCLONE_DIR_CACHE_TIME` expiry when Zurg adds or removes torrents.
- **Early detection of BluRay disc rips**: The blackhole now inspects the debrid file list immediately after a torrent is ready, before the 300-second mount wait. Torrents containing only non-media files (e.g. `.m2ts` BluRay rips) are auto-blocklisted and deleted from debrid, allowing the arr to grab a different release. Works across all three debrid providers (RealDebrid, AllDebrid, TorBox). The library scanner also sweeps the mount hourly for existing disc rips and cleans them up automatically.
- **Dashboard shows blackhole and local-library mounts**: The status dashboard previously only listed rclone debrid mounts under `/data/`. It now also lists the blackhole watch and completed directories, plus the local-library TV and movie paths, each tagged with its role (Debrid / Blackhole / Local Library). Rows with missing-on-disk paths surface as "Missing" so a misconfigured bind mount is obvious at a glance instead of being invisible.

### Fixed

- **Dashboard System circles no longer touch on mobile**: The System card's Memory/CPU/Disk stat rings were fixed at 140×140px while their mobile containers shrank to ~92px, causing the rings to overflow and visibly touch on phones. Rings now scale fluidly within their container (capped at 140px) and the inner value font shrinks to match, keeping the three circles cleanly spaced on narrow viewports.
- **Processes status no longer wraps on mobile**: The Status cell in the Processes table showed the green/red dot on one line and the "Running"/"Stopped" label on the next when the column got narrow. The cell is now `white-space:nowrap`, keeping the dot and label inline on all viewports.
- **Processes and Mounts status columns are now centered**: The Status column in both the Processes and Mounts tables was left-aligned, which made the dot+label drift toward the left edge and feel disconnected from its narrower header. Both cell and header are now centered, matching the PID/Restarts convention, and Mounts status labels (e.g. "Not mounted", "Not accessible") also stay on a single line.
- **Activity Time and Type columns centered**: The Time and Type headers sat flush-left above their narrow, visually-symmetric cell contents (timestamps and colored badges). Both headers and the matching cells now center, so the columns read as tidy vertical stacks.
- **Blocklist Hash header and Source cell centered**: On the Blocklist tab the Hash header is now centered over its narrow column, and the Source column's auto/manual badge is centered within the cell so the badge sits visually under the header.
- **Confirm dialogs now center on screen**: Dialogs opened via `showConfirm()` (e.g. the Clear button on the Activity and Blocklist tabs) were rendering in the top-left corner because the global `*{margin:0}` reset in the base CSS overrode the browser's default `<dialog>{margin:auto}` centering. Added an explicit `margin:auto` to the dialog style so modals center correctly in both dark and light themes.
- **Activity titles hyperlink to the library detail page**: Canonical show/movie names in the Activity table are now clickable links that open the corresponding library detail page (e.g. clicking "Breaking Bad" on a Rescan row jumps to `/library?detail=Breaking+Bad&type=show&from=activity`). Linking is enabled whenever the event was enriched with `media_title` or the event came from the library scanner (where `title` is already canonical); raw torrent filenames and scheduler task names stay plain. The library page's URL restorer also now falls back to the other list when the `type=` hint points to the wrong tab, and bypasses the saved-filter-dependent `_displayedItems` lookup so a detail link still opens even when the user's persisted source/status/year filters would have hidden the target from the grid. When the link carries `from=activity`, the detail view's back button becomes "← Back to Activity" and routes back to the Activity page instead of the library grid.
- **Confirm dialogs no longer overflow on narrow phones**: The `max-width:380px` dialog rule could clip horizontally on viewports under ~380px. Switched to `max-width:min(380px,calc(100vw - 32px))` so the dialog always fits the viewport with a 16px gutter on each side.
- **Activity filter no longer shows empty results from stale page state**: Changing the event type filter or search query while paged deep into a large "All Types" result set (e.g. page 25 of 48) would keep the same page index and hand the server a page that was past the end of the now-smaller filtered set, so the API returned no rows and the UI rendered "No activity recorded yet" — making rarer event types like Failed / Cleanup / Source Switch / Blocklisted / Auto-Blocked look like they were never being logged. The filter dropdown, search input, clear-history action, and Escape-to-clear handler now explicitly reset to page 1, so filter changes always show the first page of matching events.
- **Activity table shows canonical media titles**: Rescan and search events were logged with technical identifiers like "Sonarr series 123" / "Radarr movie 456" / "Sonarr episodes [1,2]" in the `title` field while the real show/movie name sat in `media_title`. The Activity table now prefers `media_title` for display and falls back to `title` for legacy rows and events without enrichment (e.g. raw torrent filenames from the blackhole), so "Rescan" rows finally show "Breaking Bad" instead of a database ID.
- **Mobile hamburger button feels lighter and less intrusive**: The sidebar toggle was rendered as a card-colored tile with uneven padding and a baseline-aligned icon, making it feel like a second floating card sitting on top of every page. It now uses the page background with a thin border, equal 7px padding for a clean square, a block-level SVG to drop baseline space, and a subtle blue hover/focus accent. The mobile page top padding was also trimmed from 48px to 44px so content sits closer to the button without being covered by it.
- **Show detail no longer auto-expands most recent season**: The show detail page previously force-expanded the first (most recent) season regardless of state. Seasons now only auto-expand when they have active state — pending searches, incomplete episode counts, or episodes airing within 30 days.
- **BluRay disc rips miscategorized as shows**: Zurg's `has_episodes` filter incorrectly matches BluRay disc rips (numbered `.m2ts` files) as TV shows, placing them in `shows/` instead of `movies/`. pd_zurg now reclassifies items in the shows category as movies when they contain no recognizable media files (extensions not in `MEDIA_EXTENSIONS`). Items with valid media files but non-standard naming (e.g. anime) still respect Zurg's category hint. This fixes cross-source matching — previously, a local movie copy couldn't merge with its debrid counterpart because they were in different type lists (movie vs phantom show with 0 episodes), causing the title to stay stuck on "Local" source.
- **System Tasks table stacks into cards on mobile**: The scheduled-tasks table on the System page packed 7 columns (Task, Interval, Last Run, Duration, Result, Next Run, Actions) with no fixed widths, so long task identifiers like `duplicate_cleanup_sweep` pushed the row offscreen on phone viewports. Under `@media(max-width:600px)` each task now renders as a bordered card with the task name on top, the run result on its own line, a muted meta row with interval/last/next/duration, and the Run button bottom-right with a larger touch target. Flex `order` handles visual sequencing so the JS row renderer stays untouched.
- **System Config key/value table stacks on mobile**: The running-configuration table set `white-space:nowrap` on monospace keys, so a long `RCLONE_POLL_INTERVAL`-style key plus its value overflowed horizontally on phones. Each config row now stacks the key as a small uppercase label above the value, with `word-break:break-all` on the value so long paths wrap cleanly.
- **Settings list rows no longer overflow on mobile**: `.list-row` flex containers (used for env-var list and pair inputs) left their inputs at default `min-width:auto`, so a long URL or path kept the input at content width and pushed the delete button offscreen on narrow viewports. Inputs inside `.list-row` now set `min-width:0` under `@media(max-width:600px)` so they compress to the available flex track. The OAuth device-code display also shrinks from 1.8em to 1.3em with tighter letter-spacing on phones so 9-character codes fit the panel.
- **Activity tabs stack into cards on mobile**: The History and Blocklist tables overflowed horizontally on phone-width viewports (~375-414px) because their fixed-width columns (Time/Type/Source on History; Hash/Date/Source/Actions on Blocklist) left almost no room for Title and Detail/Reason. Both tabs now switch to a card-stacked layout under `@media(max-width:600px)`: History cards show a meta header (time + type badge + source) above the title and detail; Blocklist cards show title and reason on top, a meta row with hash/date/source below, and a larger-touch-target Remove button at the bottom-right. The tap-to-copy hash behavior and library-detail hyperlinks on History titles are preserved. Desktop layout is unchanged.
- **Blackhole Phase 2 no longer times out waiting for visible new torrents**: When Zurg ingested a new torrent the FUSE mount could stay stale for the full 300s mount-wait, even though the torrent was clearly cached and served via WebDAV. Two compounding causes: (1) rclone was started with `--poll-interval=0`, so it never actively diffed the backend, leaving the kernel FUSE dentry cache to decide when to revalidate on its own; (2) the blackhole called `vfs/forget` once before the poll loop, but `vfs/forget` only clears rclone's in-process VFS — it does not emit kernel `FUSE_NOTIFY_INVAL_ENTRY`, so the kernel kept returning cached listings for up to `--dir-cache-time`. Rclone mounts now run with `--poll-interval=15s` (tunable via `RCLONE_POLL_INTERVAL`) so the backend is actively diffed and kernel invalidations are emitted automatically, and the blackhole kicks an immediate `vfs/refresh` at the start of Phase 2 to catch the new torrent before rclone's next poll tick.

## Version [2.17.6] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **Delete now fully cleans up all artifacts**: Deleting a show/movie from the library now also removes debrid torrents, local library symlinks, preferences, pending state, and TMDB cache entries. Previously, only the Sonarr/Radarr entry was deleted, leaving orphaned symlinks and debrid content that caused the title to reappear on the next library scan.

## Version [2.17.5] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- **Year-aware debrid symlink matching**: Torrents with year-disambiguated titles (e.g. "The Bridge 2013") now correctly match the right Sonarr/Radarr series when multiple same-title entries exist (e.g. "The Bridge (2011)" vs "The Bridge (2013)"). Previously, the parsed year was discarded during arr lookup, causing symlinks to land in whichever series was indexed first.
- **Year-aware TMDB cache keys**: Same-title-different-year shows/movies now get distinct TMDB cache entries (e.g. "the bridge (2011)" vs "the bridge (2013)") instead of colliding on a yearless key. Fixes wrong posters and metadata for year-disambiguated titles. Existing yearless cache entries are still found via fallback and expire naturally after 7 days.
- **SIGHUP reload no longer clobbers docker-compose env vars**: The config reload was clearing environment variables set via docker-compose (not in `.env`) because the removal detection compared against `os.environ` instead of the previous `.env` contents. This broke rclone mounts, blackhole, and other services after a SIGHUP. Now only tracks and removes keys that were actually in `.env`.

## Version [2.17.4] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- **"Airing Today" episode badge**: Episodes with an air date matching today now show an amber "Airing Today" badge instead of the misleading red "Missing" badge. Tomorrow's episodes remain "Upcoming" (blue) and past-date episodes remain "Missing" (red).
- **History data enrichment**: History events from the blackhole (grabbed, cached, failed, symlinked) and arr client (search/rescan triggered) now include canonical media titles via a new `media_title` field. Previously these events used torrent filenames or technical IDs, making them invisible on show/movie detail pages.
- **Activity timeline sidebar**: The detail page now features a sticky sidebar on the right with a timeline-style activity feed. Events are grouped by day ("Today", "Yesterday", etc.) with colored dots by category (acquisition/failure/action/management), Unicode icons, and episode badges. Replaces the old collapsed history section at the bottom of the page.

### Changed

- **Detail page layout**: Widened from 900px to 1200px max-width. Content below the hero is now a two-column layout: main content (seasons/actions) on the left, activity sidebar on the right. Collapses to single column on mobile (<768px).
- **History sidebar auto-loads**: Activity timeline loads automatically when opening a detail page instead of requiring a click to expand.
- **System events filtered**: Scheduler events (Library Scan, Housekeeping, Stale Grab Detection) and startup blocklist-skip events are excluded from the detail page timeline to reduce noise.

## Version [2.17.3] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **Blocklist expiry**: New `BLOCKLIST_EXPIRY_DAYS` setting auto-expires auto-added blocklist entries after N days (default: 0/disabled). Manual entries are kept forever. Runs during daily housekeeping.
- **Expanded config backup**: Daily backup now includes `blocklist.json` and `history.jsonl` alongside `.env`, `settings.json`, and `preferences.json`.

### Fixed

- **Shutdown/reload race condition**: SIGHUP config reload now checks the `_shutting_down` flag before restarting services, preventing a race where reload could spawn new processes after shutdown cleanup.
- **Dependency-aware process restarts**: The process monitor now defers rclone restarts when Zurg is down (and plex_debrid when rclone is down) instead of consuming retry budget against a dead dependency.
- **Orphaned debrid torrents on crash**: Blackhole pipeline now writes to `pending_monitors.json` immediately after debrid submission, before file cleanup. Previously a crash between submission and pending write would leave an untracked torrent in the debrid account.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md accuracy**: Fixed misleading `.replace()` pseudocode (actual code uses `startswith` + slice), corrected notification threading description (synchronous, not per-call threads), added missing history rotation to housekeeping docs, documented `STATUS_UI_AUTH`, Docker `HEALTHCHECK`, and `while True` signal loop.

## Version [2.17.2] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Pending failure context**: Pending entries now track `last_error`, `retry_count`, and `next_retry_at` fields. The library UI shows error reasons, retry counts, and time-until-next-retry for items stuck in "Searching" state, replacing the opaque "Searching" badge with actionable context.
- **Pending warning notifications**: New `pending_warning` notification event fires once when items are stuck searching for 24+ hours (configurable via `PENDING_WARNING_HOURS` env var, default 24), bridging the silent gap between first search and 3-day escalation.
- **Blackhole alt-exhaustion notification**: When all alternative releases are exhausted for a blackhole item, a `download_error` notification is now sent and a history event logged. Previously the file moved to `failed/` with no user signal.
- **Architecture guide**: Added `ARCHITECTURE.md` — a developer reference documenting module layers, data flows, cross-container path model, threading model, scheduled tasks, and error recovery patterns.
- **Rclone VFS cache configuration**: `RCLONE_VFS_CACHE_MODE`, `RCLONE_VFS_CACHE_MAX_SIZE`, and `RCLONE_VFS_CACHE_MAX_AGE` are now configurable via environment variables and the settings UI. Previously `--vfs-cache-mode` and `--dir-cache-time` were hardcoded, ignoring user-set values.
- **`BLOCKLIST_AUTO_ADD` in settings UI**: The auto-blocklist toggle is now configurable from the Blackhole section of the settings editor instead of requiring manual `.env` edits.

### Fixed

- **Radarr retry count inflation**: Fixed "No debrid results found" on the Radarr path incorrectly incrementing `retry_count` on every scan cycle, causing misleadingly high failure counts in the UI. Now matches the Sonarr path (`increment_retry=False`).
- **Pending warning notification reliability**: `warned_at` is now persisted only after the notification is successfully sent. Previously, a failed notification would permanently mark the item as warned, silently skipping the alert with no retry.
- **Attribute XSS in library UI**: Replaced all `esc()` calls in HTML attribute contexts with `escAttr()` (which also escapes `"` and `'`). The previous `esc()` function only escaped `<`, `>`, and `&`, leaving attribute breakout possible via crafted titles — especially in the torrent search results table where data is attacker-controlled.
- **Version string**: Fixed the version reported at startup (was stuck at `2.11.0`).
- **Settings URL validation**: Sonarr, Radarr, and Torrentio URLs are now validated for correct format (must start with `http://` or `https://`) when saving settings, matching the existing validation for Plex and Overseerr URLs.
- **`MEDIA_EXTENSIONS` naming consistency**: Renamed `_MEDIA_EXTENSIONS` in `scheduled_tasks.py` to `MEDIA_EXTENSIONS` to match `library.py` and `blackhole.py`, reducing risk of the three sets drifting out of sync.
- **`LIBRARY_PREFERENCE_AUTO_ENFORCE` undocumented**: Added to README.md configuration reference.

## Version [2.17.1] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **Multi-season torrent splitting**: Blackhole symlink mode now auto-detects multi-season packs (e.g., "Show.S01-S05.1080p") and splits them into per-season directories with Sonarr-parseable names. Supports `S01-S05`, `S01-05`, `Seasons 1-5`, `Complete Series/Collection`, and cross-season episode ranges. Falls back to single-directory behavior when files lack parseable season info.
- **Extended system metrics**: The Status dashboard System card now displays disk space (`/config` volume) as a third ring chart alongside Memory and CPU, plus a compact info row showing container uptime, open file descriptors, and live network I/O rates. All new metrics include health indicator thresholds (>60% warn, >85% critical) and Prometheus gauge exports.
- **Local library mount health monitoring**: Mount liveness probe now checks local library paths (movies/TV) for real (non-symlink) media files. When a network mount (NFS/SMB) drops silently, the probe detects the absence of real files within ~60 seconds and sends a `health_error` notification.
- **Library scanner mount-drop alert**: The library scanner now tracks whether local content was previously found. If local items drop to zero after being present, it logs a warning and sends a one-time `health_error` notification instead of silently skipping symlink creation.
- **Symlink repair worker**: Broken debrid symlinks are now repaired before deletion. When content moves between Zurg mount categories (e.g., `movies/` → `shows/`), the symlink is automatically recreated with the correct path. When content is truly gone, an optional `SYMLINK_REPAIR_AUTO_SEARCH` setting triggers Sonarr/Radarr to re-search, sharing the existing 2-hour cooldown to prevent search storms. Repair activity is logged to history and sent via the new `symlink_repaired` notification event.

### Changed

- **Larger system metric rings**: Increased the Status dashboard System ring chart size from 110px to 140px so longer values (e.g., "1105.5s", "75.6G / 116.3G") fit within the rings without clipping.

### Fixed

- **Prefer-debrid search retry**: Debrid migration searches that silently fail (e.g., all indexers down, no results) are now automatically retried every 6 hours instead of being permanently skipped. Previously, a single failed search attempt would leave the title stuck in "Migrating to Debrid" until the 3-day escalation timeout.
- **Untagged torrent indexers invisible to debrid series**: Sonarr/Radarr v4 requires indexers to share a tag with the series — untagged indexers are no longer universal. `_fix_indexer_routing` now adds the debrid tag to untagged torrent indexers, not just those already carrying the local tag. Previously, debrid-tagged series saw "0 active indexers" and searches silently returned nothing.
- **Prefer-debrid skipped for episodes with existing files**: Sonarr/Radarr won't re-download episodes that already meet the quality cutoff, even when the download client routing changes to debrid. `ensure_and_search` now uses interactive search + manual push to bypass the cutoff when `prefer_debrid=True` and episodes already have files, force-grabbing a torrent release through the blackhole.
- **Season-aware TMDB show matching**: Fixed a bug where shows sharing a common title across reboots/revivals (e.g. Netflix "Marvel's Daredevil" vs Disney+ "Daredevil: Born Again") could receive the wrong poster, metadata, and Sonarr folder assignment. When the primary TMDB cache entry doesn't cover the show's season range, the system now searches for alternative cache entries with matching title words that do cover the needed season.
- **Blocklist modal**: Replaced native browser `prompt()` dialog with a styled in-app modal for blocking torrents. Preset reasons are now clickable buttons with a custom reason input field, matching the application's dark theme.
- **Migrating badge alignment**: Fixed vertical misalignment between source badge and "Migrating" badge in episode rows by adding `vertical-align:middle` and proper spacing.
- **Episode table mobile responsiveness**: Hid torrent filenames and file sizes on small screens, moved air dates below episode titles, added flex-wrap to season header buttons, and tightened cell padding for a cleaner mobile layout.
- **Sonarr/Radarr history API compatibility**: The `detect_stale_grabs` task no longer sends the `eventType` query parameter to `/api/v3/history`, which older Sonarr/Radarr versions reject with HTTP 400. Filtering is now done client-side for universal compatibility.

## Version [2.17.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- **Sidebar navigation**: Replaced the horizontal top navigation bar with a fixed left sidebar inspired by Sonarr/Radarr. Includes SVG icons, active-state left border accent, dark/light theme support, and a mobile hamburger menu with slide-out overlay.
- **Activity page**: New dedicated page at `/activity` with two tabs — History (event log with type filter, search, pagination) and Blocklist (manage blocked torrents). Previously these were buried at the bottom of the dashboard.
- **System page**: New dedicated page at `/system` with three tabs — Logs (level filter, search, wrap/auto-scroll), Tasks (scheduled task management with manual run), and Config (running configuration + "How it Works" reference). Previously these required scrolling through the entire dashboard.
- **Shared JS utilities**: Common functions (`esc`, `timeAgo`, `fmt`, `fmtBytes`, `showConfirm`, auth detection) extracted into a shared module available to all pages, eliminating duplication.

### Changed

- **Dashboard slimmed to Status page**: The dashboard now shows only health-critical information — services, processes, mounts, system stats, and recent events. Activity, blocklist, logs, tasks, and config have moved to their dedicated pages.
- **Wanted sidebar highlighting**: Navigating to the library with `?filter=missing` now highlights "Wanted" in the sidebar instead of "Library".

## Version [2.16.2] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- **Movie prefer-debrid auto-enforcement**: Movies with `prefer-debrid` preference now automatically replace the local file with a debrid symlink when `source=both` is detected during library scans. Previously only TV shows had this auto-enforcement — movies required a manual second click.
- **Blackhole dedup bypass for prefer-debrid**: The blackhole local dedup check now respects source preferences. Previously it would reject debrid grabs for titles that already existed locally, blocking the prefer-debrid workflow entirely.
- **Stale source badge after enforcement**: After auto-enforcement replaced a local file with a debrid symlink, the UI continued showing "Local & Debrid" until the next scan. The library cache is now invalidated immediately after enforcement so the next UI poll reflects the correct source.
- **Switch to Debrid button deleting local-only movies**: For movies with only a local copy, clicking "Switch to Debrid" would delete the local file without searching for a debrid alternative — the user lost their only copy. It now saves a prefer-debrid preference and triggers a Radarr search, preserving the local file until the debrid copy arrives and auto-enforcement swaps it.
- **Slow preference enforcement after blackhole completion**: After a torrent completed and symlinks were created, auto-enforcement of source preferences could be delayed up to 1 hour (the default library scan interval). The blackhole now triggers a library scan immediately after symlink creation.
- **Refresh button exits detail view**: Clicking the Refresh button while on a movie or show detail page would navigate back to the library grid instead of refreshing the detail page in place. The grid re-render is now skipped when in detail view, matching the behavior of the auto-refresh path.
- **Browser refresh loses detail view**: Pressing F5 or using the browser refresh button on a movie/show detail page would return to the library grid. The detail view now persists its state in the URL (`?detail=...&type=...`) so browser refresh restores it.

## Version [2.16.1] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- **Delete from Sonarr/Radarr**: Movie and show detail pages now have a "Delete from Radarr/Sonarr" button that removes the entry and its files from the respective arr service. Includes two-click confirmation, history logging (`arr_deleted` event), and notification support.
- **Expandable descriptions**: Show/movie overview text can now be clicked to expand the full description instead of being permanently truncated with a fade.

### Changed

- **Search modal redesign**: Removed the "Cached only" checkbox and "Cached" column (Real-Debrid deprecated their instantAvailability endpoint in Nov 2024, so cache status was always empty). Added a dedicated "Indexer" column, widened the modal, and centered data columns. Search results now sort by quality then seeds. The backend no longer makes the failing cache check API call, so searches return faster.

### Fixed

- **Detail page action buttons**: "Delete from Radarr/Sonarr" and "Search Torrents" buttons now display in a horizontal row instead of stacking vertically. "Switch to Debrid" is no longer styled as a destructive (red) action. Block button is now an icon-only (🚫) with tooltip, moved to the action row.
- **Badge spacing**: Source badge (Local/Debrid) under movie/show titles now has proper spacing from the title.
- **Quality badge text wrapping**: Quality badges like "WEB-DL 1080p" and "Remux 1080p" no longer wrap onto two lines in episode tables.
- **Apply button sizing**: The source preference Apply button now matches the dropdown's proportions.
- **Badge spacing**: Added breathing room between the title and the source badge on detail pages.
- **Description fade**: The overview text fade-out gradient now starts at 85% instead of 60%, so only the very bottom edge fades.

## Version [2.16.0] - 2026-04-01

### Changed

- **Shared CSS Foundation**: Extracted common CSS variables, reset, typography, spinner, banner, footer, focus styles, and reduced-motion preferences into a new `utils/ui_common.py` module. All three web pages (Dashboard, Library, Settings) now share a single source of truth for base styles instead of maintaining independent copies. Dashboard now includes `--input-bg`/`--input-border`/`--input-focus` variables for consistency.
- **Unified Navigation Bar**: All three pages now use an identical navigation bar generated by `get_nav_html()`, replacing three different header/nav implementations. Navigation includes pd_zurg brand, Dashboard, Library, Wanted (with badge count), Settings, and theme toggle. Active page is highlighted with `aria-current="page"`. Responsive layout collapses gracefully below 640px.
- **Standardized Button System**: Replaced three independent button vocabularies (`.btn-restart`/`.btn-run`, `.btn-action`/`.btn-apply`/`.btn-refresh`, `.btn`/`.btn-primary`/`.btn-secondary`) with a unified set: `.btn` (base), `.btn-ghost` (transparent), `.btn-primary` (filled green), `.btn-danger` (destructive), `.btn-sm` (small), `.btn-icon` (square). Confirming and dirty states preserved.

### Fixed

- **Wanted nav link 404**: The "Wanted" navigation link (`/library?filter=missing`) returned a 404 because the server route used exact path matching, ignoring query parameters.
- **Wanted filter showing empty results**: Clicking the nav "Wanted" link defaulted to the movies tab, showing "No results match your filters" when all missing content was in shows. The library now auto-switches to the tab that has matching items.

### Added

- **Data Freshness Indicator**: Dashboard now shows "Updated Xs ago" next to uptime, with a pulsing dot during active fetch and red indicator on connection loss.
- **Card Priority Signaling**: Dashboard cards display colored left-border accents based on health state — green (healthy), yellow (warnings like rate limits near threshold), red (errors like service down or mount failure). Health is evaluated per-card for Services, Processes, Mounts, System, and Events.
- **System Stats Progress Rings**: CPU and Memory stats now feature SVG circular progress rings behind the numeric values, color-coded by percentage (green <60%, yellow 60-85%, red >85%).
- **Dynamic Favicon**: The browser tab favicon is now an SVG lightning bolt that changes color based on overall system health (green/yellow/red). Updates on each status poll on the dashboard, and via a lightweight 30-second poller on Library and Settings pages.
- **Library Sort Options**: Added "Year (Newest)", "Year (Oldest)", and "% Complete" sort options to the library browser. Shows-only sorts (Episodes, % Complete) are hidden when viewing movies. Sort preference persists in localStorage.
- **Colored Poster Placeholders**: When TMDB poster art is unavailable, items now display a Netflix/Plex-style colored-initial placeholder — a large first letter centered on a deterministic hue-based radial gradient, with the title text below.
- **Jump Bar Improvements**: The A-Z jump bar now adapts responsively: thinner at 640-900px, converts to a horizontal sticky scroll bar at 480-640px (instead of disappearing), and shows a tooltip with the first title for each letter on hover.
- **Sticky Save Bar**: Settings editor now shows a fixed bar at the bottom of the viewport when there are unsaved changes, with an accurate change count, Save & Apply, and Discard buttons.
- **Category Modification Indicators**: Settings category headers display a yellow dot and "N changed" badge when fields inside have been modified.
- **Search Result Highlighting**: Settings search highlights matching text in field labels, help text, and category names using `<mark>` elements.
- **Per-Field Reset**: Each modified settings field shows an undo button (↺) that reverts that individual field to its last-saved value.
- **Gzip Compression**: All HTML and JSON responses from the status server are now gzip-compressed when the client supports it, reducing transfer sizes by ~70-80%. Compressed pages are cached by content hash for zero-overhead repeat requests.
- **Cache Headers**: HTML pages now include ETag and Cache-Control headers. Browsers can send conditional requests with If-None-Match to receive 304 Not Modified responses, avoiding unnecessary re-transfers. API endpoints use Cache-Control: no-store for always-fresh data.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: All pages now support keyboard navigation — `/` to focus search, `R` to refresh, `Escape` to close modals or clear search, `1`/`2`/`3` to switch tabs, `?` to show a help overlay. Shortcuts are disabled while typing in inputs. Relevant buttons show shortcut hints in tooltips.
- **Toast Notifications**: New `showToast(message, type, duration)` system available on all pages. Toasts appear bottom-right, stack up to 5 deep, auto-dismiss (5s success, 8s warning, persistent errors), and slide in/out with animation. Migrated `alert()` calls and added toast echoes for settings save results.
- **Recently Added Filter**: New purple "Recently Added" pill in the library filter bar shows the 20 most recently added items sorted by date, with automatic jump bar and sort override handling.
- **Provider Health Card**: Dashboard service cards for debrid providers now display API call counts, error rates, average response times, and rate limit usage. A color-coded rate limit bar visualizes remaining quota. A warning banner appears when rate limit usage exceeds 80%.
- **Structured Activity History**: All debrid pipeline events (grabs, cache hits, symlinks, failures, source switches, searches, rescans, task completions) are now logged to persistent JSONL storage. New Activity section on the dashboard displays events in a filterable, paginated table with type badges and auto-refresh. Per-show/movie history is available as a collapsible section in the library detail view. History is automatically rotated based on `HISTORY_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30). API endpoints: `GET /api/history`, `GET /api/history/show/{title}`, `DELETE /api/history`.
- **Mass Editor**: Library browser now supports bulk selection mode — click "Select" to toggle checkboxes on poster cards, shift-click for range selection, then apply preferences or trigger missing-episode searches across multiple shows/movies at once via a fixed action bar. Selections persist across tab switches.
- **File Quality Badges**: Library browser now displays parsed quality information (resolution, source, codec, HDR) extracted from media filenames. Episode rows show color-coded badges (e.g., "WEB-DL 1080p") with file sizes. Poster cards display a resolution corner badge (4K/1080p/720p) for at-a-glance quality visibility.
- **Library Sorting & Filtering**: Library browser now supports sorting by A-Z, Z-A, Newest Added, Year, Episode Count, and Size. New filter dropdowns for show status (Continuing/Ended) and year range (2020s, 2010s, 2000s, Older). The jump bar automatically hides for non-alphabetical sorts. All sort and filter preferences persist across page loads via localStorage.
- **Blocklist**: Torrent blocklist system for permanently rejecting bad debrid torrents by info hash. Blocklisted hashes are automatically skipped during blackhole processing and library symlink creation. Torrents that hit terminal debrid errors (virus, dead, magnet error) are auto-blocklisted when `BLOCKLIST_AUTO_ADD=true` (default). Dashboard Blocklist section shows all entries with title, hash, reason, date, and source. "Block" button available on debrid-sourced episodes and movies in the library detail view with preset reason options. API endpoints: `GET /api/blocklist`, `POST /api/blocklist`, `DELETE /api/blocklist/{id}`, `DELETE /api/blocklist`. Persists across restarts in `/config/blocklist.json`.
- **Wanted/Missing Filter**: Library browser now has quick-filter preset pills — Missing (aired episodes without files), Unavailable (debrid search exhausted), Pending (active transitions), and Fallback (downloading locally). Each pill shows a live count. A "Wanted" link with badge appears in the nav bar when items need attention. Bulk actions appear when a preset is active: "Search All on Debrid" for missing items and "Download All Locally" for unavailable items, both rate-limited with progress feedback. Filters are linkable via URL query parameters (e.g., `/library?filter=missing`).
- **Enhanced Notification Events**: Five new notification event types for granular debrid pipeline visibility: `symlink_created` (batch notification when debrid symlinks are added to local library), `symlink_failed` (warning when symlink creation fails), `debrid_unavailable` (warning when content is marked unavailable after threshold), `local_fallback_triggered` (when local download starts as debrid fallback), and `blocklist_added` (when a torrent is blocklisted). All events are filterable via `NOTIFICATION_EVENTS`. Optional daily digest (`NOTIFICATION_DIGEST_ENABLED=true`, `NOTIFICATION_DIGEST_TIME=08:00`) sends a single summary of the day's pipeline activity instead of individual notifications.
- **Interactive Debrid Search**: Search for torrents directly from the library detail view using Torrentio. Set `TORRENTIO_URL` (e.g. `https://torrentio.strem.fun`) to enable. Movie detail views and episode rows show a "Search Torrents" button that opens a modal with results including release name, quality badge, size, seeders, and instant-availability (cached) status on your debrid provider. Results are sortable by quality, size, seeds, or cached status, with a "Cached only" filter toggle and minimum quality dropdown. One-click "Add" sends the torrent to your debrid provider (Real-Debrid, AllDebrid, or TorBox) with visual feedback. IMDb IDs are automatically resolved from TMDB metadata for accurate search results. History events and notifications are emitted on add success/failure (`debrid_add_success`, `debrid_add_failed`). API endpoints: `POST /api/search`, `POST /api/search/add`.

## Version [2.15.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- **Debrid search escalation**: Episodes stuck searching on debrid are automatically marked "debrid unavailable" after a configurable threshold (`DEBRID_UNAVAILABLE_THRESHOLD_DAYS`, default 3 days). UI shows a "Debrid N/A" badge and stops retrying.
- **Local fallback download**: "Download Locally" button appears for debrid-unavailable episodes and movies. Routes downloads through local/usenet indexers while preserving the series prefer-debrid setting. Automatically re-routes the series back to debrid after the local download completes.

### Fixed

- **Pending state cleanup**: `set_pending` now writes a `created` timestamp, fixing a bug where housekeeping could never clean up stale pending entries (they accumulated forever).
- **Pending state path traversal**: Fixed `_cleanup_empty_dirs` boundary check in `library_prefs.py` that could match sibling directories.

## Version [2.14.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- **Usenet-preferred local routing**: "Prefer Local" now routes downloads exclusively through usenet clients (NZBget/SABnzbd) when available, using a dedicated `usenet` tag. Falls back to any local client if no usenet client is configured. Usenet indexers are tagged with both `local` and `usenet` tags to support both routing modes.
- **Download client routing**: Automatically routes downloads through debrid or local download clients in Sonarr/Radarr based on source preference. Auto-tags untagged download clients, tags usenet indexers with local tag, and manages dual-tag exclusivity to prevent debrid interception of local downloads.
- **Sonarr-style poster cards**: Library browser now shows poster images with progress bars, replacing the plain list view. Includes TMDB metadata enrichment for poster artwork.
- **TMDB dedup and alias merge**: Debrid entries sharing a TMDB ID but with different parsed titles (e.g. "Andor" vs "Star Wars Andor") are deduplicated. Cross-source merge now uses TMDB IDs to match debrid and local items even when titles differ. TMDB disambiguation used when adding shows/movies to Sonarr/Radarr.
- **Alphabetical jump bar**: Library browser includes an A-Z jump bar that scales dynamically with viewport height for quick navigation through large libraries.
- **Centralized task scheduler**: Background task scheduler with WebUI for periodic maintenance tasks (library scan, symlink verification, duplicate cleanup) with configurable intervals.
- **Prefer-debrid active search**: Titles with prefer-debrid preference now actively search Sonarr/Radarr for debrid copies of local-only episodes, with search budgets and cooldown to avoid API spam.
- **Auto-retry alternative releases**: Blackhole automatically retries with alternative releases when a debrid provider rejects a torrent, and detects stale grabs that never completed.
- **Episode-aware blackhole dedup**: Deduplication now checks at the episode level instead of season level, preventing false positives when only some episodes exist locally.
- **Fuzzy title matching**: Debrid symlink creation uses fuzzy/normalized title matching for arr folder names, handling punctuation differences like "(500) Days of Summer" vs "500 Days of Summer".
- **Library UI overhaul**: 13 improvements inspired by Overseerr, Sonarr, and Maintainerr — including preference help text formatting, pending badge state distinction (migrating vs searching), and missing env vars added to Settings UI.
- **Direct WebDAV scanning**: Library scanner now queries Zurg's WebDAV API directly via PROPFIND, bypassing the FUSE/rclone mount for directory enumeration. Reduces mount scan time from 10-20 seconds to under 1 second. Falls back to FUSE scanning automatically if Zurg is unreachable.
- **Smart refresh polling**: Library refresh button now polls the backend until the scan completes, replacing the fixed 3-second delay. Shows a scanning indicator and updates the UI automatically when data is ready. Includes error feedback for timeouts and server failures.

### Changed

- **Split scan architecture**: Library scan is now split into a fast read-only phase (mount enumeration, cross-referencing, TMDB enrichment) and a background effects phase (preference enforcement, arr searches, symlink creation). The UI receives fresh library data after the read phase completes (~1-5s) while effects continue running in the background (~30-60s).
- **Season pack preference**: Scanner now prefers season pack files over individual episode downloads, using per-season episode count to avoid lower-quality mega-packs beating higher-quality season packs.
- **Fresh preferences**: `/api/library` response always returns preferences fresh from disk instead of using stale scan-time values.
- **Concurrent scan protection**: Added `_effects_running` guard to prevent overlapping preference enforcement and arr API calls from concurrent refresh requests.
- **Cache safety**: API responses now use a shallow copy of cached scan data to prevent mutation of the shared cache object across concurrent requests.
- **Stale cache during scan**: `get_data()` returns stale cached data when a background scan is running instead of triggering a duplicate synchronous scan.
- **Grid re-render optimization**: Smart poll skips full grid re-render to prevent poster image flicker during background data updates.

### Fixed

- **Indexer routing**: Debrid tag now applied to torrent indexers, and re-search triggered for missing content after routing changes.
- **Library scanner rescans**: Fixed rescan triggers and improved symlink target path validation to reject paths outside the mount.
- **False 'both' source**: Debrid symlinks in local library scan no longer cause false 'both' source classification. Expanded `verify_symlinks` to check local library directories.
- **Title parsing**: Filter non-media folders (plex versions, subs, featurettes), fix empty parentheses in titles, and prevent MAX title corruption from quality pattern over-matching.
- **RD torrent monitoring**: Fixed monitor polling deleted RD torrents and accept `selectFiles` 202 status responses.
- **Alt-retry race condition**: Hardened failure paths in automatic alternative release retry logic.
- **Episode dedup regex**: Updated to handle Sonarr-standard naming patterns (S01E01 format).
- **Download routing e2e**: Fixed usenet client skipping, indexer downloadClientId override clearing, and stale unavailable queue item cleanup.
- **Stale pending entries**: Auto-clear pending entries for titles removed from the library.
- **TMDB year-filter search failure**: TMDB searches with a year filter now retry without the year when the filtered search returns no results. Fixes shows like "Marvel's Spidey and His Amazing Friends" where the folder year (season air date) doesn't match the show's premiere year, preventing TMDB caching and alias-based dedup.
- **WebDAV scanner Zurg compatibility**: WebDAV PROPFIND scanner now handles both absolute (`/dav/movies/...`) and relative (`folder/file`) hrefs from Zurg. Also detects when Zurg doesn't support recursive depth-infinity PROPFIND (returns folders without files) and falls back to FUSE mount scanning automatically.
- **Stale debrid symlink cleanup**: `verify_symlinks` now checks symlinks pointing to `BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_TARGET_BASE` (e.g. `/mnt/debrid/`) in addition to the rclone mount path. Previously only checked the mount path, so symlinks created with a different target base were never cleaned up when torrents expired.
- **Faster debrid library on startup**: When the rclone mount appears after the initial scan has already started, the scanner now automatically triggers a follow-up scan so debrid content appears within seconds instead of waiting for the next scheduled scan (up to 2 minutes).
- **Title parsing for mid-string year**: Folder names like `Movie (2000) DC (1080p BluRay...)` now correctly extract the year before quality truncation, preventing mangled titles like `Movie (2000) DC (1080p` and duplicate library entries without posters.
- **Symlink creation guard for empty local library**: Debrid symlink creation now skips when the local library scan found zero local content, preventing symlink pollution when network mounts (NFS/SMB) aren't propagated into the container.
- **TMDB year-preference matching**: TMDB search now prefers results whose release year matches the folder year instead of blindly taking the first (most popular) result. Only activates when the top result is >2 years off (avoiding false corrections from season air years), limits scan to top 5 results, and skips year preference entirely on fallback-no-year retries. Fixes movies like "Cover Up (2025)" incorrectly showing the poster and metadata for the 1983 French film "La Crime".
- **Verify symlinks deleting valid debrid symlinks**: `verify_symlinks` and blackhole's `_cleanup_symlinks` were checking symlink targets against `BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_TARGET_BASE` (e.g. `/mnt/debrid`) which only exists inside Radarr/Sonarr's container, not pd_zurg's. Every debrid symlink appeared broken and was removed. Now translates target paths to the rclone mount before checking existence. Also adds a mount health check (aborts if rclone mount is unresponsive), a safety threshold (refuses to delete >50 symlinks if >50% appear broken), and cleans up empty parent directories after deletion so the library scanner doesn't misclassify them as local content.
- **Phantom local movie classification**: After symlinks were deleted, movie folders containing only Radarr metadata (.nfo, .jpg) but no media files were misclassified as `source='local'`, permanently blocking symlink recreation. `_scan_local_movies` now requires at least one media file to classify a directory as local. Same fix applied to shows via `_scan_local_shows`.
- **Symlink dir name mismatch with Radarr**: Debrid symlinks were created under the torrent-parsed title (e.g. `F1 The Movie (2025)`) instead of Radarr's canonical folder name (`F1 (2025)`). Added TMDB ID-based fallback matching when title lookup against Radarr fails, so the symlink lands in the correct Radarr-managed folder. Also fixed `_norm_for_matching` to treat hyphens as word separators ("Cover-Up" matches "Cover Up") and `&` as "and" ("Me, Myself & Irene" matches "Me Myself And Irene"). Movies with `source='both'` now also get symlinks created in Radarr's folder when it's empty, fixing the case where a wrong-named symlink dir existed but Radarr's canonical dir was empty.

## Version [2.13.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- **Auto-create debrid symlinks**: When `BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_ENABLED=true` and local library paths are configured, the library scanner automatically creates organized symlinks in the local TV/movie library for debrid-only content. Sonarr/Radarr can then discover content that only exists on the debrid mount without manual import. Symlinks use canonical arr folder names when available.
- **Sonarr/Radarr rescan triggers**: After creating debrid symlinks, automatically triggers disk rescans in Sonarr (RescanSeries) and Radarr (RescanMovie) so they pick up new files without manual intervention.
- **Sonarr-inspired episode list UX**: Seasons sorted newest-first, color-coded progress pills (green=complete, yellow=partial, gray=empty), Expand All / Collapse All button, collapse footer on long seasons, formatted air dates (e.g., "Mar 15, 2025").
- **Pending state auto-cleanup**: Every library scan checks pending "Switching to debrid/local" entries against actual episode sources and clears resolved ones, even for manual changes outside the app.

### Fixed

- **Stale pending badges**: "Switching to debrid" badges persisted forever because switch-to-debrid and remove-local endpoints never cleared pending state. Now cleared immediately after successful operations.
- **applyMoviePreference prefer-debrid path**: Missing `_actionInFlight` guard and error recovery caused buttons to get permanently disabled after network failures.
- **Keydown listener leak**: Debrid removal confirmation dialog leaked keyboard event listeners when the DOM was destroyed by navigation or re-render.
- **Log file selection**: `read_log_lines` picked log files by mtime (unreliable for same-second writes), now uses lexicographic sort on date-stamped filenames.
- **Thread safety**: `get_all_pending()` now acquires `_pending_lock` for consistent reads.
- **Direction validation**: `set_pending()` rejects invalid direction values to prevent permanently stale entries.
- **XSS hardening**: Season numbers escaped in data attributes, log messages use `%r` formatting.

## Version [2.12.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- **Web-based settings editor**: Browser-based configuration for pd_zurg environment variables and plex_debrid settings.json with proper input types, inline validation, and SIGHUP reload (no container restart needed)
- **Quality profile editor**: JSON editor for plex_debrid quality profiles with first-run setup experience
- **OAuth device code flows**: Connect Trakt, Debrid Link, Put.io, and Orionoid accounts directly from the settings editor
- **Settings import/export**: Download or upload .env and settings files for backup and migration
- **Blackhole symlink mode**: Creates symlinks from completed debrid downloads to a target directory for Sonarr/Radarr import — zero-copy, no local storage used
- **Local library dedup**: Checks existing TV/movie library before submitting torrents to debrid to avoid duplicate downloads (`BLACKHOLE_DEDUP_ENABLED`)
- **RD account dedup**: Deduplicates incoming torrents against existing Real-Debrid account torrents before submitting
- **Workflow diagrams**: Interactive "How it works" diagrams in the status dashboard showing Watchlist and Arr+Blackhole flows with component glossary
- **Status UI enhancements**: Log viewer with level filtering, process restart buttons, running config viewer, mount event history
- **Service health checks**: Dashboard shows connectivity status and premium expiry for debrid, Plex, Overseerr, and other integrated services
- **Config validation**: Startup validation of environment variables with clear error messages
- **SIGHUP reload**: Reload pd_zurg configuration without restarting the container
- **.env import button**: Restore configuration from a previously exported .env file via the settings editor
- **Bidirectional settings sync**: Changes in .env propagate to plex_debrid settings.json and vice versa
- **DUPLICATE_CLEANUP_KEEP**: New option to control which copy is kept during duplicate cleanup — `local` (default, logs Zurg dupes) or `zurg` (deletes local copy)

### Changed

- `.env` is now the single source of configuration — docker-compose.yml no longer contains inline env vars, making it safe to pull updates without losing settings
- Duplicate cleanup reworked: skips Zurg copies by default (read-only mount), logs summary at INFO level with per-item detail at DEBUG
- NFS mode documented as not creating a local mount — cross-machine WebDAV setup recommended instead

### Fixed

- `atomic_write()` crash from invalid kwargs passed to `mkstemp()`
- Auth lockout: StatusHandler credentials now update on SIGHUP reload
- Phantom AllDebrid instance created when only Real-Debrid is configured
- False Plex/Jellyfin conflict error during startup validation
- Crash when `AUTO_UPDATE_INTERVAL` is set to empty string
- `SimpleNamespace` missing `.status` attribute crash in RD torrent info handling
- Environment variables overridden by stale `/config/.env` on container restart
- Log viewer stuck displaying rotated log file after log rotation
- Single-file torrent extension mismatch in blackhole symlinks
- Stale config after SIGHUP reload, missing service triggers, and settings sync gaps
- JS syntax error in status UI restart button handler
- Dashboard layout issues: header spacing, column alignment, stat centering


## Version [2.11.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added

- **Process auto-restart**: Crashed processes are automatically detected and restarted with exponential backoff (5s → 300s), sliding window restart counting, and max restart limits
- **Zombie reaping**: `SIGCHLD` set to `SIG_IGN` for automatic kernel-level zombie child reaping without conflicting with subprocess management
- **Apprise notifications**: Event-driven notifications to 90+ services (Discord, Telegram, Slack, email, etc.) via `NOTIFICATION_URL` environment variable, with event and severity filtering
- **Blackhole watch folder**: Arr-stack compatible watch directory for `.torrent` and `.magnet` files with Real-Debrid, AllDebrid, and TorBox support. Failed files quarantined to `failed/` subdirectory
- **ffprobe stuck-process recovery**: Monitors for ffprobe processes stuck in uninterruptible sleep on debrid mounts, attempts recovery via I/O poke, then kills after max attempts
- **Status Web UI**: Lightweight dashboard at `/status` with JSON API at `/api/status`, showing process health, mount status, cgroup-aware system stats, and recent events. Optional basic auth
- **MDBList content source**: Subscribe to curated MDBList lists (IMDB Top 250, trending, custom) that feed plex_debrid's download pipeline. Configure via plex_debrid settings menu
- **Atomic config writes**: Zurg config.yml and rclone.config updates use temp-file-then-rename to prevent corruption on crash
- **Wait-for-URL with exponential backoff**: Extracted generic `wait_for_url()` utility from rclone module with 5s → 60s exponential backoff
- **Ordered shutdown**: Per-process shutdown timeouts (plex_debrid: 15s, Zurg/rclone: 10s) with elapsed time logging

### Changed

- Process registry changed from tuples to dicts for extensibility
- `stop_process()` now disables auto-restart to prevent spurious restarts during update cycles
- Shutdown notification sent after critical cleanup with 5s timeout thread

## Version [2.10.0] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed

- Torrentio: Fixed `qualityfilter` parameter format for current Torrentio API
- Error handling: Replaced bare `except: pass` in main.py that silently swallowed all exceptions including SystemExit and KeyboardInterrupt
- Error handling: Flattened 3-4 levels of nested try/except that re-wrapped exceptions and lost tracebacks
- Healthcheck: Removed redundant in-process healthcheck subprocess loop (Dockerfile HEALTHCHECK already handles this)
- Thread safety: Fixed SubprocessLogger thread join hangs by checking stop_event in read loops and adding join timeouts

### Added

- FLARESOLVERR_URL: Optional environment variable to enable FlareSolverr proxy for Torrentio scraping when Cloudflare protection blocks direct requests
- Graceful shutdown: All tracked child processes (Zurg, rclone, plex_debrid) are now terminated on SIGTERM/SIGINT before unmounting filesystems
- Port collision detection: Random port assignment for Zurg and rclone NFS now checks availability via socket binding
- Rclone config backup: Existing `/config/rclone.config` is backed up to `.bak` before being overwritten on startup
- Config class: Configuration variables wrapped in a `Config` class with `load()` method for testability and runtime reload
- `__all__` defined in `base/__init__.py` to control wildcard import scope

### Changed

- Dockerfile: Pinned rclone to 1.73.2, Python base to 3.11.12-alpine3.21, zurg-testing files to commit SHA
- Duplicate cleanup: Merged near-identical `process_tv_shows()` and `process_movies()` into shared function with single PlexServer instance
- docker-compose.yml: Removed deprecated `version: "3.8"` key
- main.py: Replaced `threading.Event().wait()` with `signal.pause()` for idle loop
- Removed duplicate `import zipfile` in `base/__init__.py`
- Removed unused `from urllib import response` in `utils/download.py`

* Trakt OAuth [fixed](https://github.com/elfhosted/plex_debrid/commit/c678fa1e5974a5c666b2fe70d65228c6fdfb4047) (*by passing your own client ID / secret in ENV vars*).
* Integrated with [Zilean](https://github.com/iPromKnight/zilean/) for scraping [DebridMediaManager](https://debridmediamanager.com/) (DMM) public hashes, defaults to ElfHosted internal Zilean service.
* Parametize watchlist loop interval (*defaults to 30s instead of hard-coded 30 min*)
* Single episode downloads [fixed](https://github.com/elfhosted/plex_debrid/pull/1)

- **Zilean support is not yet implemented in pd_zurg, but will be in a future release**
