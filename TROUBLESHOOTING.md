## DMM shows torrents at 0% with no seeds

Those are torrents your debrid provider accepted but can't actually
stream — uncached releases that will never download. Two paths can put
them in your account: the manual "Add" button in the Library search UI
and the Sonarr/Radarr blackhole watcher, plus the automated
`plex_debrid` flow if you use it.

**Fix, by provider:**

| Your provider | What to flip ON in Settings |
|---|---|
| **Real-Debrid** | `PD_ENFORCE_CACHED_VERSIONS`. RD has no working pre-add cache probe, so this is the only gate that works on RD — it configures plex_debrid to reject uncached releases after they're probed post-add. |
| **AllDebrid or TorBox** | `BLACKHOLE_REQUIRE_CACHED` and `SEARCH_REQUIRE_CACHED`. These use AD/TB's working cache-probe endpoints to refuse uncached releases before they're submitted. You can also flip `PD_ENFORCE_CACHED_VERSIONS` if you use plex_debrid. |

After flipping the setting, hit Save & Apply in the UI. For
`PD_ENFORCE_CACHED_VERSIONS` a plex_debrid restart is needed — the UI
will prompt you.

Already-added uncached torrents have to be deleted manually from DMM /
the RD web UI — the gates only prevent new ones.

## Uncached torrents pile up on my debrid account from the blackhole

Related to the previous entry but more specific: when Sonarr/Radarr drop
a `.magnet` / `.torrent` into the blackhole and the hash never caches
on your debrid provider, Zurgarr times out waiting (5 min by default,
`BLACKHOLE_MOUNT_POLL_TIMEOUT`) and stops tracking it — but the
torrent **stays on your debrid account as a 0%/0-seed entry**. Over
time these accumulate.

Most visible on **Real-Debrid** because RD has no pre-add cache probe
(`BLACKHOLE_REQUIRE_CACHED` can't help you), and most visible on shows
with a `prefer-debrid` preference + `GAP_FILL_ENABLED=true` — gap-fill
finds missing episodes, Sonarr searches Torrentio, drops magnets,
~75% don't cache.

**Fix:** flip `BLACKHOLE_DELETE_UNCACHED_ON_TIMEOUT` to ON in the
Settings UI (Blackhole section). After the timeout, Zurgarr will
actively delete the still-uncached torrent from the debrid account
instead of abandoning it. Logs the deletion and emits a `failed`
history event with `reason=uncached_timeout` so you can audit what was
removed.

Default is OFF because it changes data state (deletes torrents) and
some users tolerate long cache waits. Turn it on explicitly once
you're sure you don't want the behaviour.

For the backlog already on your account, clean it out once from DMM or
the RD web UI — the gate only affects new drops from the blackhole.

## Duplicate torrents in my debrid account

Handled automatically as of v2.21. The `BLACKHOLE_DEBRID_DEDUP_ENABLED`
and `SEARCH_DEDUP_ENABLED` settings both default to **ON** — before any
add, Zurgarr checks whether the hash is already on your account and
skips if it is.

If you're still seeing duplicates:

- Confirm both settings are ON in the Settings UI (they should be unless
  you explicitly turned them off).
- Remember the existing duplicates won't clean themselves up — only new
  adds are gated. Clear the backlog from DMM / the RD web UI once.
- Torrents added **before** v2.21 won't be caught retroactively — the
  feature only filters new submissions.

## Sonarr/Radarr keeps re-grabbing the same failed torrent

The blocklist should prevent this. It auto-blocks torrents that hit
terminal debrid errors (`BLOCKLIST_AUTO_ADD` defaults to **ON**).

- Check `http://your-host:8080/blocklist` — the offending hash should
  be there.
- If `BLOCKLIST_EXPIRY_DAYS` is non-zero, auto-added entries expire
  after that many days. Set it to `0` to keep them forever.
- Manual entries in `/blocklist` are never expired.

If the re-grabs keep happening for different hashes of the same release
(quality variants), that's Sonarr/Radarr's normal retry behavior after
import failures — check your arr's Activity → Queue tab for stuck items.

## Mount not available / empty `/data` directory

- Ensure `/dev/fuse` is mapped and the container has `SYS_ADMIN`
  capability. Docker Compose:
  ```yaml
  devices:
    - /dev/fuse:/dev/fuse:rwm
  cap_add:
    - SYS_ADMIN
  security_opt:
    - apparmor:unconfined
    - no-new-privileges
  ```
- Check rclone logs: `docker logs zurgarr 2>&1 | grep rclone`
- Verify your debrid API key is valid and the account is active.

## Docker Desktop: mount propagation error

Docker Desktop doesn't support the `rshared` mount propagation rclone
needs. Options:

- Use a Linux VM, WSL2, or bare-metal Docker.
- The [upstream pd_zurg wiki](https://github.com/I-am-PUID-0/pd_zurg/wiki/Setup-Guides)
  has WSL2 setup instructions — most steps still apply.

## Plex not seeing debrid content

- The Plex library must point to the rclone mount shared from Zurgarr
  (the `./mnt:/data:shared` bind in `docker-compose.yml`).
- If your Plex container uses `depends_on: service_healthy`, make sure
  Zurgarr's healthcheck is passing first.
- Try `PLEX_REFRESH=true` with `PLEX_MOUNT_DIR` set to the mount path
  **as Plex sees it** (not the path inside the Zurgarr container).

## Blackhole: symlinks created but broken

The symlinks are absolute paths rooted at `BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_TARGET_BASE`.
That path must resolve on every host reading the symlinks — Plex,
Sonarr, Radarr — not just inside the Zurgarr container.

- Set `BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_TARGET_BASE` to the mount path used by your
  media-server hosts (e.g. `/mnt/debrid`).
- If hosts use different mount paths, create a symlink on each:
  `ln -s /actual/mount/path /mnt/debrid`
- Verify the rclone/WebDAV mount is accessible from the host running
  Plex/Sonarr/Radarr — try `ls /mnt/debrid/` from there.

See the [Blackhole Symlink Guide](BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_GUIDE.md#troubleshooting)
for detailed diagnostics.

## Stuck ffprobe processes

Normal when Plex scans expired debrid links — the monitor handles it
automatically. If you see false positives during large library scans,
increase `FFPROBE_STUCK_TIMEOUT` (default 300s).

## Migrating from pd_zurg

### Compose file

- Rename `container_name`, `image`, and the service key:
  `pd_zurg` → `zurgarr`. Old Docker Hub images under `fjmerc/pd_zurg`
  remain accessible; new pushes go to `fjmerc/zurgarr`.

### Mount path

- The default rclone mount name changed from `pd_zurg` to `zurgarr`. If
  you set `RCLONE_MOUNT_NAME` explicitly, nothing changes. If you
  relied on the default, your mount path becomes `/data/zurgarr` —
  update `BLACKHOLE_RCLONE_MOUNT` and `PLEX_MOUNT_DIR` accordingly.

### Env vars (2.20.0 hard break)

Env var keys, Prometheus metric names, localStorage keys, on-disk
sidecar extensions, and the internal logger channel / log filename have
all completed their rename to the `zurgarr` / `ZURGARR` namespace as of
**2.20.0**.

Upgrading directly from pd_zurg (pre-2.19) requires user action before
first start:

- Rename any `PDZURG_LOG_*` entries in `.env` to `ZURGARR_LOG_*`.
- Rewrite Grafana / Alertmanager / recording-rule queries from
  `pd_zurg_*` to `zurgarr_*`.
- Update any external log shipper or tail pipeline keyed on the
  `PDZURG-YYYY-MM-DD.log` filename pattern to `ZURGARR-YYYY-MM-DD.log`.

The 2.19.0 release provided a dual-read / dual-emit deprecation window
for the env var and metric surfaces; 2.20.0 removed it. Users
upgrading from 2.19.x who already migrated during that window need no
further action.

Stale `/log/PDZURG-*.log` files from pre-2.20 aren't rotated or
auto-cleaned by `ZURGARR_LOG_COUNT` on the new filename — delete them
manually if disk footprint matters.

### Browser auth

Browser-saved Basic Auth credentials for `/settings` may need to be
re-saved (the auth realm changed from `pd_zurg` to `Zurgarr`).
