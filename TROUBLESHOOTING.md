## DMM shows torrents at 0% with no seeds

Those are torrents your debrid provider accepted but can't actually
stream — uncached releases that will never download. Two paths can put
them in your account: the manual "Add" button in the Library search UI
and the Sonarr/Radarr blackhole watcher, plus the automated
`plex_debrid` flow if you use it.

**Fix, by provider:**

| Your provider | What to flip ON in Settings |
|---|---|
| **Real-Debrid** | `PD_ENFORCE_CACHED_VERSIONS`. RD has no working pre-add cache probe, so this is the only gate that works on RD — it configures plex_debrid to reject uncached releases after they're probed post-add. |
| **AllDebrid or TorBox** | `BLACKHOLE_REQUIRE_CACHED` and `SEARCH_REQUIRE_CACHED`. These use AD/TB's working cache-probe endpoints to refuse uncached releases before they're submitted. You can also flip `PD_ENFORCE_CACHED_VERSIONS` if you use plex_debrid. |

After flipping the setting, hit Save & Apply in the UI. For
`PD_ENFORCE_CACHED_VERSIONS` a plex_debrid restart is needed — the UI
will prompt you.

Already-added uncached torrents have to be deleted manually from DMM /
the RD web UI — the gates only prevent new ones.

## Uncached torrents pile up on my debrid account from the blackhole

Related to the previous entry but more specific: when Sonarr/Radarr drop
a `.magnet` / `.torrent` into the blackhole and the hash never caches
on your debrid provider, Zurgarr times out waiting (5 min by default,
`BLACKHOLE_MOUNT_POLL_TIMEOUT`) and stops tracking it — but the
torrent **stays on your debrid account as a 0%/0-seed entry**. Over
time these accumulate.

Most visible on **Real-Debrid** because RD has no pre-add cache probe
(`BLACKHOLE_REQUIRE_CACHED` can't help you), and most visible on shows
with a `prefer-debrid` preference + `GAP_FILL_ENABLED=true` — gap-fill
finds missing episodes, Sonarr searches Torrentio, drops magnets,
~75% don't cache.

**Fix:** flip `BLACKHOLE_DELETE_UNCACHED_ON_TIMEOUT` to ON in the
Settings UI (Blackhole section). After the timeout, Zurgarr will
actively delete the still-uncached torrent from the debrid account
instead of abandoning it. Logs the deletion and emits a `failed`
history event with `reason=uncached_timeout` so you can audit what was
removed.

Default is OFF because it changes data state (deletes torrents) and
some users tolerate long cache waits. Turn it on explicitly once
you're sure you don't want the behaviour.

For the backlog already on your account, clean it out once from DMM or
the RD web UI — the gate only affects new drops from the blackhole.

## Duplicate torrents in my debrid account

Handled automatically as of v2.21. The `BLACKHOLE_DEBRID_DEDUP_ENABLED`
and `SEARCH_DEDUP_ENABLED` settings both default to **ON** — before any
add, Zurgarr checks whether the hash is already on your account and
skips if it is.

If you're still seeing duplicates:

- Confirm both settings are ON in the Settings UI (they should be unless
  you explicitly turned them off).
- Remember the existing duplicates won't clean themselves up — only new
  adds are gated. Clear the backlog from DMM / the RD web UI once.
- Torrents added **before** v2.21 won't be caught retroactively — the
  feature only filters new submissions.

## Search results show `–` in the Cached column

`–` means the cache status is **unknown**, and for most providers that's
permanent: only TorBox still exposes a working pre-add cache probe.
Real-Debrid deprecated its endpoint in Nov 2024 and AllDebrid
discontinued its endpoint in May 2026 — there is no way to know whether
a hash is cached on RD/AD before adding it.

- **TorBox key configured** (alone or alongside RD/AD): badges show
  `TB ✓` (cached on TorBox) or `✗` (confirmed not cached). A few `–`
  entries below the top results are normal — probing is capped to the
  best 25 releases per search to keep the modal fast.
- **RD or AD only**: every row shows `–`. This is expected, not a bug.

Note the badge is a *TorBox* verdict — a `TB ✓` release added to
Real-Debrid may still be uncached there.

## Sonarr/Radarr keeps re-grabbing the same failed torrent

The blocklist should prevent this. It auto-blocks torrents that hit
terminal debrid errors, disc-rip rejection, or uncached-timeout
(`BLOCKLIST_AUTO_ADD` defaults to **ON**).

- Check `http://your-host:8080/blocklist` — the offending hash should
  be there.
- If `BLOCKLIST_EXPIRY_DAYS` is non-zero, auto-added entries expire
  after that many days. Set it to `0` to keep them forever.
- Manual entries in `/blocklist` are never expired.

**Common case: dead-swarm release on an old show.** A UK BBC show or a
2006-era series whose only release matching your quality profile has 0
seeders never caches on debrid. The Activity feed will show a series of
`grabbed → failed (Timed out uncached)` pairs every ~6 hours for the
same release. The blocklist now catches this on first failure and the
next `.magnet` drop with the same info-hash is rejected before it ever
hits the debrid API (`blocklisted` event in the feed). If you want
Sonarr to mark the grab as failed in *its* history too (so it auto-
searches an alternative release on its next pass), do it manually from
Sonarr Activity → History → blue X — pd_zurg's blocklist doesn't
currently push grab-fail back to the arr.

If the re-grabs keep happening for different hashes of the same release
(quality variants), that's Sonarr/Radarr's normal retry behavior after
import failures — check your arr's Activity → Queue tab for stuck items.

## Mount not available / empty `/data` directory

- Ensure `/dev/fuse` is mapped and the container has `SYS_ADMIN`
  capability. Docker Compose:
  ```yaml
  devices:
    - /dev/fuse:/dev/fuse:rwm
  cap_add:
    - SYS_ADMIN
  security_opt:
    - apparmor:unconfined
    - no-new-privileges
  ```
- Check rclone logs: `docker logs zurgarr 2>&1 | grep rclone`
- Verify your debrid API key is valid and the account is active.

## Mount missing after a host reboot ("Skipping rclone setup" in logs)

Your host rebooted (or crashed and came back), the container started, but
one or more mounts under `/data` are missing and the logs show:

```
The Zurg WebDAV (...) URL ... is not accessible within the timeout period. Skipping rclone setup for ...
```

This happens when the container starts before the host's network/DNS is
ready, so the WebDAV readiness probe times out and that mount's setup is
skipped.

As long as `MOUNT_SELFHEAL_ENABLED` is not set to `false` (default `true`),
the mount liveness probe retries the skipped setup automatically — first
retry within ~70 seconds, then at most once per 10 minutes per mount —
and the mount comes up on its own once the endpoint is reachable. A
successful deferred start appears in the Activity feed as a `repair`
event ("Deferred rclone setup succeeded").

If self-heal is disabled, restart the container once the network is up.
If Plex runs on the host (not in a container), it may hold stale FUSE
handles from before the mount disappeared — restart Plex after the mount
returns if files still show as unavailable.

## Library shows only debrid content after a host reboot (local library appears empty)

The host rebooted, everything looks healthy, but the Library page shows
only debrid-sourced content — shows and movies you have as real local
files are missing, or a show with a full local run displays just one or
two debrid episodes. The log prints this every scan:

```
[library] Skipping debrid symlink creation — local library appears empty (network mount may not be ready)
```

and after a few scans you get a "Local Library Never Seen" warning
notification (if notifications are enabled).

This happens when the local library path
(`BLACKHOLE_LOCAL_LIBRARY_TV`/`_MOVIES`) is bind-mounted from a host
directory that is itself a network mount (NFS/SMB), and docker starts
the container before that share is mounted after boot. The bind then
captures the bare underlying directory — and bind mounts don't follow
later host remounts, so the container is stuck looking at an empty (or
stale) directory even though the host sees the share fine.

**Immediate fix:** restart the container once the host share is mounted.

**Durable fix:** add `:rslave` propagation to the local library binds
(and any other binds whose host source is a network mount, such as the
blackhole/completed dirs) so host-side remounts propagate into the
running container:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - /mnt/nas/media/tv:/local_media/tv:rslave
      - /mnt/nas/media/movies:/local_media/movies:rslave
```

You can confirm the stale state before restarting: compare
`stat -c %i /path/on/host` with
`docker exec <container> stat -c %i /local_media/tv` — different inode
numbers mean the container is bound to a different filesystem object
than the host is showing.

## TorBox mount fails to authenticate / 401 Invalid credentials

You set `TORBOX_API_KEY` and your container logs show
`401 Invalid credentials` or `Auth failed` against `webdav.torbox.app`,
and `/data/torbox/` stays empty.

The TorBox API key does **not** authenticate WebDAV. TorBox treats the
WebDAV endpoint as a separately authenticated service with its own
user + password. Setup:

1. Log in at https://torbox.app
2. Go to **Settings → Integrations → WebDAV**
3. Generate (or copy) the **WebDAV password** — this is a per-account
   credential distinct from your login password and the API key.
4. In your `.env`, set:
   ```
   TORBOX_WEBDAV_USER=your-account@email
   TORBOX_WEBDAV_PASS=the-webdav-password-from-step-3
   ```
5. While you're in TorBox's WebDAV settings, **disable WebDAV flatten**
   — the rclone mount expects the `Classic` (category-folder) layout.
6. `docker compose up -d` to apply.

Without `TORBOX_WEBDAV_USER` and `TORBOX_WEBDAV_PASS`, the WebDAV mount
is skipped (logged as a startup warning) but the API-key-only features
— cache probes, search-add, blackhole routing — continue to work.

## TorBox content that played fine last week is suddenly gone

A show or movie backed by TorBox stops playing, the file has vanished
from `/data/torbox/`, and its library symlink is broken — nothing in
the logs except the eventual symlink cleanup/repair.

TorBox deletes stored torrents when they reach their server-side
expiry date (visible per torrent as `expires_at` in their API — plans
differ on the window, and inactivity shortens it). Zurgarr's reactive
paths (`verify_symlinks`, the library scanner) only notice *after* the
deletion, when the target is already gone.

The **Debrid Quota & Expiry** cards on the System page show, per
provider, exactly which torrents fall inside the warning window
(default 7 days, `DEBRID_EXPIRY_WARN_DAYS`), and a
`debrid_expiry_warning` notification fires when new content enters the
window (subscribe via `NOTIFICATION_EVENTS`). When you get the warning:
play or re-download the listed items on TorBox to refresh their
activity, or accept that the arrs will re-acquire them after expiry.
The sweep runs every 6 h (`DEBRID_QUOTA_INTERVAL`) and can be
triggered manually from the System page ("Run sweep now" on the quota
card). Real-Debrid does not publish per-torrent expiry, so only account
expiry and storage totals can be shown for RD.

## Docker Desktop: mount propagation error

Docker Desktop doesn't support the `rshared` mount propagation rclone
needs. Options:

- Use a Linux VM, WSL2, or bare-metal Docker.
- The [upstream pd_zurg wiki](https://github.com/I-am-PUID-0/pd_zurg/wiki/Setup-Guides)
  has WSL2 setup instructions — most steps still apply.

## Plex not seeing debrid content

- The Plex library must point to the rclone mount shared from Zurgarr
  (the `./mnt:/data:shared` bind in `docker-compose.yml`).
- If your Plex container uses `depends_on: service_healthy`, make sure
  Zurgarr's healthcheck is passing first.
- Try `PLEX_REFRESH=true` with `PLEX_MOUNT_DIR` set to the mount path
  **as Plex sees it** (not the path inside the Zurgarr container).

## New shows/movies only appear in Plex after a manual scan

Symptom: content downloads fine and shows up in Sonarr/Radarr (and on
disk), but Plex doesn't show it until you manually scan the library.
It's intermittent — some titles appear on their own, others don't.

Cause: nothing was telling Plex to scan. Content the library scanner
symlinks into the arr's media folder is discovered by a Sonarr/Radarr
*disk rescan* (`RescanSeries`/`RescanMovie`), not an import — so the
arr's own "Update Library" Plex connection (which only fires on import)
never triggers for it. Zurg's `on_library_update` hook only covers
RealDebrid content, not the separate TorBox rclone mount. And Plex's own
"scan my library automatically" relies on filesystem change events that
don't propagate through rclone/FUSE mounts. So TorBox/scanner-delivered
titles land on disk with no scan trigger — while content Sonarr/Radarr
genuinely *imports* still refreshes Plex via the arr connection, which is
why it looks intermittent.

Fix: set `PLEX_REFRESH=true` (plus `PLEX_ADDRESS` and `PLEX_TOKEN`). The
library scanner then asks Plex to refresh the affected sections (show
sections when shows were symlinked, movie sections for movies) after it
creates the symlinks — once per scan cycle, only when something new was
added. Plex's scanner is incremental, so it only processes changed files.

Stopgap without this: enable Plex's "Scan my library periodically" on the
TV/Movie libraries so scanner-delivered content is picked up on a
schedule instead of never.

## Sonarr says `hasFile=false` right after a scan but imports correctly a minute later

Symptom: a fresh grab lands, the library scanner creates the symlink in
`/local_media/tv/<show>/Season XX/...` (or the Radarr equivalent), and
zurgarr's logs show `Triggered Sonarr rescan for <title>`. Sonarr's own
log shows `Scanning <show>` followed by `Completed scanning disk` with
zero imports. A few minutes later — or if you click "Refresh & Scan"
manually — Sonarr imports the file cleanly.

Cause: when the symlink target lives on an NFS share that Sonarr/Radarr
reads (typical when the arr container is on a different host from the
debrid mount), the arr-side kernel attribute cache hides the just-created
symlinks for ~30-60 seconds. The rescan walk runs *before* the cache
refreshes, sees nothing new, and completes successfully — Sonarr then
won't re-scan that show until the next library_scan cycle (default 1h)
re-triggers it.

Fix: set `LIBRARY_RESCAN_NFS_DELAY=30` (or whatever your NFS attribute-
cache TTL is — `actimeo=` on the mount, default usually 30-60s). The
library scanner will sleep that many seconds between symlink creation
and the arr rescan trigger, giving the cache time to invalidate.

Local-filesystem arr-side libraries don't need this (the file is visible
immediately) — keep the default `0`. Clamped to `[0, 300]` so a typo
can't stall the scan loop indefinitely.

## Blackhole: symlinks created but broken

The symlinks are absolute paths rooted at `BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_TARGET_BASE`.
That path must resolve on every host reading the symlinks — Plex,
Sonarr, Radarr — not just inside the Zurgarr container.

- Set `BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_TARGET_BASE` to the mount path used by your
  media-server hosts (e.g. `/mnt/debrid`).
- If hosts use different mount paths, create a symlink on each:
  `ln -s /actual/mount/path /mnt/debrid`
- Verify the rclone/WebDAV mount is accessible from the host running
  Plex/Sonarr/Radarr — try `ls /mnt/debrid/` from there.

See the [Blackhole Symlink Guide](BLACKHOLE_SYMLINK_GUIDE.md#troubleshooting)
for detailed diagnostics.

## Stuck ffprobe processes

Normal when Plex scans expired debrid links — the monitor handles it
automatically. If you see false positives during large library scans,
increase `FFPROBE_STUCK_TIMEOUT` (default 300s).

## Dashboard buttons fail with "cross-origin request rejected" behind a reverse proxy

State-changing requests (library refresh, delete, settings save, etc.)
verify the browser's `Origin` header against the request's `Host`
header (or `X-Forwarded-Host`, if your proxy sends it) — a CSRF guard
that blocks a malicious page from firing those endpoints using your
browser's saved credentials. If Zurgarr is served through a reverse
proxy or accessed by a hostname different from the one the container
sees on `Host` (e.g. `https://zurgarr.example.com` in front of
`http://192.168.1.8:8080`), the Origin won't match and the request is
rejected even though you're the legitimate operator.

A proxy that sets `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host` (or
equivalent) is enough on its own — the guard accepts a match against
either header, so no further config is needed. Only set
`STATUS_UI_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` if your proxy does not forward the original
hostname at all: the public origin(s) the dashboard is actually
accessed from — `scheme://host[:port]`, comma-separated for more than
one (e.g. `https://zurgarr.example.com,https://zurgarr.lan`). The match
is case-insensitive, but use lowercase and omit default ports (`:443`
for `https`, `:80` for `http`) to match what browsers actually send in
the `Origin` header. Then reload config: Settings → **Save & Reload**,
or send the container a `SIGHUP`.

Direct IP:port access (no proxy, no hostname rewrite) needs no entry —
Origin and Host already match.

**If you're already locked out** (every POST/DELETE — including the
Settings-save button — 403s with "cross-origin request rejected"), the
Settings page can't save you out of it: the save action is itself a
blocked POST. Edit `STATUS_UI_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` directly in the `.env`
file on the host, then reload without going through the UI: `docker
kill -s HUP <container>` (the container picks up the new value via its
`SIGHUP` handler — no restart needed).

## I lost my config after a rebuild / restore from an old backup

Scheduled tar.gz archives land in `/config/backups/` (one every 24h by
default, keeping the last 7). Open the Settings page → **Backup &
Restore** → expand **Recent backups** to see them, then click
**Restore** on any entry. The current `.env`, `settings.json`,
`library_prefs.json`, and `blocklist.json` are snapshotted to
`/config/backups/pre-restore-<timestamp>/` before being overwritten, so
the restore itself is reversible — copy the snapshot files back if you
restored the wrong archive.

If the container isn't running, the archives are plain tar.gz files:
`tar -tzf /config/backups/zurgarr-backup-*.tar.gz` to inspect, `tar
-xzf ... -C /config/` to extract. The archive layout is flat (`env`,
`settings.json`, `library_prefs.json`, `blocklist.json`, `manifest.json`
— note `env` with no dot) so extract into `/config/` and rename `env` →
`.env` if restoring manually.

Disable scheduled backups by setting `CONFIG_BACKUP_INTERVAL=0`. Manual
download/restore in the Settings UI still works.

## Migrating from pd_zurg

### Compose file

- Rename `container_name`, `image`, and the service key:
  `pd_zurg` → `zurgarr`. Zurgarr is built from source (see the README
  quickstart) — there is currently no prebuilt image to pull.

### Mount path

- The default rclone mount name changed from `pd_zurg` to `zurgarr`. If
  you set `RCLONE_MOUNT_NAME` explicitly, nothing changes. If you
  relied on the default, your mount path becomes `/data/zurgarr` —
  update `BLACKHOLE_RCLONE_MOUNT` and `PLEX_MOUNT_DIR` accordingly.

### Env vars (2.20.0 hard break)

Env var keys, Prometheus metric names, localStorage keys, on-disk
sidecar extensions, and the internal logger channel / log filename have
all completed their rename to the `zurgarr` / `ZURGARR` namespace as of
**2.20.0**.

Upgrading directly from pd_zurg (pre-2.19) requires user action before
first start:

- Rename any `PDZURG_LOG_*` entries in `.env` to `ZURGARR_LOG_*`.
- Rewrite Grafana / Alertmanager / recording-rule queries from
  `pd_zurg_*` to `zurgarr_*`.
- Update any external log shipper or tail pipeline keyed on the
  `PDZURG-YYYY-MM-DD.log` filename pattern to `ZURGARR-YYYY-MM-DD.log`.

The 2.19.0 release provided a dual-read / dual-emit deprecation window
for the env var and metric surfaces; 2.20.0 removed it. Users
upgrading from 2.19.x who already migrated during that window need no
further action.

Stale `/log/PDZURG-*.log` files from pre-2.20 aren't rotated or
auto-cleaned by `ZURGARR_LOG_COUNT` on the new filename — delete them
manually if disk footprint matters.

### Browser auth

Browser-saved Basic Auth credentials for `/settings` may need to be
re-saved (the auth realm changed from `pd_zurg` to `Zurgarr`).
