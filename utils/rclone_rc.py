"""Rclone RC (remote control) API helpers.

Provides cache invalidation via rclone's RC interface so the FUSE mount
reflects Zurg changes immediately instead of waiting for dir-cache-time
expiry.

Use :func:`refresh_dir`, not :func:`forget_dir_cache`. ``vfs/forget`` only
clears rclone's in-process VFS cache without notifying the kernel FUSE
layer, so stale dentries persist. ``vfs/refresh`` re-reads from the backend
and, because it diffs new vs. existing entries, rclone emits
``FUSE_NOTIFY_INVAL_ENTRY`` for changes so the kernel drops its cached
dentries.

    """Refresh rclone's dir cache via RC ``vfs/refresh`` on all registered mounts.

    Unlike ``vfs/forget``, this re-reads the directory from the backend and
    diffs against the cached entries, emitting kernel FUSE notifications
    for added/removed items so the kernel dentry cache actually updates.

    The kernel-invalidation behaviour is FUSE-specific. On ``NFSMOUNT=true``
    rclone serves NFS instead and the kernel NFS client does its own attribute
    caching that rclone has no hook into — ``vfs/refresh`` will still update
    rclone's internal VFS, but NFS client staleness is governed by the NFS
    mount's ``acregmin``/``acregmax``/``acdirmin``/``acdirmax`` timers.

    Args:
        dir_path: Mount-relative directory, or a list of them (rclone's RC
            accepts ``dir``, ``dir2``, ``dir3``, ... in one call). Empty
            string (or empty list) refreshes the mount root (each top-level
            category dir — ``movies``, ``shows``, ``__all__`` — gets
            re-listed).
        recursive: Walk into subdirectories. Leave ``False`` for hot paths;
            recursive=True is expensive on large libraries.
        exclude_mounts: Optional iterable of mount names to skip. Use this to
            steer a recursive refresh away from mounts that don't benefit from
            a FUSE walk (e.g. the TorBox mount, enumerated via the mylist API),
            where a recursive PROPFIND is pure collateral and trips WebDAV
            listing rate-limits. ``None`` (default) refreshes every mount.
        only_mounts: Optional iterable of mount names to refresh instead of
            every mount — a folder that exists on one mount only (a TorBox
            release folder) is wasted work on the others.

    Returns:
        True if at least one mount refreshed successfully, False otherwise.
