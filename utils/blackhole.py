    """Tracks retry state for failed blackhole files via JSON sidecar files.

    State survives container restarts since it's persisted to disk.

    V2 schema (plan 33) adds a nested ``tier_state`` object for the
    quality-compromise state machine.  Legacy files without ``tier_state``
    load correctly — ``read_tier_state()`` returns ``None`` and the
    compromise engine treats that as "not yet in the compromise flow".
    Top-level keys (``retries``, ``last_attempt``, ``alt_exhausted``)
    retain their v1 semantics; ``write()`` now preserves unrelated keys
    so a retry-count bump does not wipe compromise state.

    All load-modify-save helpers serialize through ``_retry_meta_lock``
    so concurrent callers (blackhole worker + alt-retry thread) cannot
    interleave reads and writes in a way that drops an advance or
    re-seeds the dwell clock.

        When ``source_debrid`` returns a filter_block on the magnet add
        (RD's May-2026 keyword filter) and an alt debrid is configured,
        try the SAME hash on the alt.  On success: extract the alt
        torrent id, start a monitor entry on the alt, log a
        ``debrid_rescued`` history event, leave no file in the watch
        dir, notify — exactly as the success branch of ``_process_file``
        would have, but pointing at the alt provider.

        Returns ``True`` when rescued (caller should ``return``).
        Returns ``False`` on any failure mode — file is left at
        ``file_path`` for the existing alt-release / failed/ fallback
        paths.

        File handling — the rescue stages ``file_path`` to a
        uniquely-named entry under ``.alt_pending/`` BEFORE entering the
        helper's up-to-60s wait_ready poll loop.  Without that move, a
        Sonarr/Radarr re-grab of the same release name during the
        rescue window would POSIX-rename a new file over ours and the
        original grab would be silently lost when the rescue completes.
        Unique name (``.rescue-<random8>-<filename>``) prevents
        collision with the alt-release path's own staging in the same
        directory.

        Distinct from ``_try_alternative_release``: that path searches
        for a DIFFERENT release of the same media; this path tries the
        SAME hash on a DIFFERENT debrid.  Both are useful and chain
        naturally — try cross-rescue first (cheap, hit-cached only),
        fall back to alt-release search.

        Known limitation (BH-3): if the alt's add request raises mid-
        ``response.json()`` (TB serving malformed JSON during an
        incident), the alt may have allocated a torrent_id server-side
        but we have no id to delete from here — orphan on the alt
        account.  Pre-existing in ``_add_to_torbox`` regardless of
        rescue; the rescue path inherits but doesn't widen it.  A
        follow-up wired through ``_add_to_torbox`` is the right place
        to close the orphan window for all callers.
