"""Debrid health reconciler — detect RD-side filter blocks on the
existing torrent set.

Closes pd_zurg's blind spot to Real-Debrid's May 2026 keyword filter:
RD's ``/torrents`` listing still advertises blocked torrents as healthy,
so Zurg's WebDAV view and ``os.path.exists`` on the FUSE mount both
report them as present. The only way to detect a block is to probe
``/unrestrict/link`` on a sample file per torrent — which is exactly
what ``RealDebridClient.probe_file`` does (plan 38 phase 1). This
module schedules and persists that probing.

Phase 2 scope: detection + state persistence only. No remediation.
Auto-deletion + arr re-search land in phase 4.

    *candidates* is the anchor set from ``_release_anchor_candidates``;

    can produce a dangling link even though the content is there.

    The release-anchor filter is what keeps rescue scoped to ONE torrent:
    without it, the walker would rewrite every RD symlink to TB on the
