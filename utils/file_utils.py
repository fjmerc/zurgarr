    """Context manager for crash-safe atomic file writes.

    Writes to a temporary file in the same directory, then atomically
    renames to the target path on success. If an exception occurs,
    the temp file is cleaned up and the original file is untouched.

    By default, the temp file's contents and the containing directory
    are both fsync'd before/after the rename so the write survives a
    crash or power loss, not just concurrent readers. Pass
    ``fsync=False`` only for rebuildable caches where the extra fsync
    cost isn't worth it (e.g. a hot-path TMDB metadata cache that can
    just be re-fetched).

    Usage:
        with atomic_write('/path/to/config.yml') as f:
            f.write('key: value\\n')

    For binary mode:
        with atomic_write('/path/to/file', mode='wb') as f:
            f.write(b'binary data')
